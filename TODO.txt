Radical approach to make it working with simple

node lists and label list

nodelist TOP10 --- ALLNOTINTOP10  expand
labellist the same this will simplify


if -nc gray-color-to-unknown-firms and top10+other 

we must have a square for others in gray


Make business-firm-color-dictionary-json github project as a public project

Make it work for top10 legend type
Make then wortk for top 10+ others as default. All not in top 10 gend diff color.
Implement logging 

 ./formatAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py -pl test-data/5-pentagon-with-star.graphML


* Implement ll argument outside 'outside_center_right'
Mart other options as not implmented
* Mark down that node coloring and what node sizing strategies are not implemented
* Mark the legend types that are not implemented

The testcase 3 needs to be more sofisticated

Create documentation folder 
Document formatAndViz-nofi-GraphML.py add link to README.MD
Document formatAndViz-nofo-GraphML.py add link to README.MD
Document transform-nofi-2-nofo-GraphML.py add link to README.MD

Increase size of labels


Side by side - With and without Google

Fix bug isolate nodes


MEntion elegant way of combining quant. quality amd visualizaitons.

check why number of nodes is not cosisten between graphML module and scraplog

Write test for filtering emails in bash
the script should create and delete its own filters

Write down in object oriented form useing classes

- Scrapper (file, scrappingtype(org, ind, eighted)) returns nothing 

. Miner(file) returns (Graph, Co-editedFilesGroupedBydevelopers, DevelopersConnectionByCo-EdigitedFiles 

- Reporter
- Reports on graph,and developer and file statistics 

extension of Miner 
Miner_org2org_weighted
Miner_org2org_pararel
Miner_dev2de_weigted
Miner_dev2de_weigted pararel



- ScrapperResultsExporter
- ScrapperResultExporterGraphML is an extension 

- Reports on graph,and developer and file statistics 


Check networkmezure unique connections to finnish the last stats 
So slow. move 

Check that htere are other ways map cooperation

Implement option input for organization-agregation 
Implement option input for individual-agregation

Implement verbose even more verbosity - while scrapping log
