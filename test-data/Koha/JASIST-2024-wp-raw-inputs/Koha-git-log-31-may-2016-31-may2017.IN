    Bug 5395: Update C4::Acquisition::SearchOrders POD
    
    Comparing the perldoc to the function:
    - basketname
    - basketgroupname
    - budget_id
    Were missing. This adds them.
    
    Also, a description of ordernumber and search were
    added, as they are not self-evident by their name
    alone.
    
    There are no code changes, so all tests should pass
    or fail identically before and after patch.

    Bug 18669 - RewriteCond affecting wrong rule in koha-httpd.conf
    
    One of the RewriteCond directives in koha-httpd.conf was affecting
    the wrong RewriteRule after its original RewriteRule was commented out
    years ago.
    
    _TEST PLAN_
    0) Before applying patch, build Koha from source
        *) make
        *) make install (or make upgrade)
        *) Copy or symlink etc/koha-httpd.conf to your Apache vhost directory
            (and enable if you're on a Debian based system)
        *) Restart Apache
    1) Make sure that you have at least 1 bibliographic record in Koha
    (URL like this http://server:port/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=1)
    2) Go to http://server:port/bib/1
    3) Note that you get a 404 error
    4) Apply the patch
    5) Rebuild Koha from source as per step 0
    6) Go to http://server:port/bib/1
    7) Note that you now see the same page as you would if you went to
    http://server:port/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=1

    Bug 18664: Make IssueSlip returns if params are not valid
    
    Problem raised by bug 17762: IssueSlip should return if the params are
    not valid.
    The tests contain 2 FIXME to highlight this problem already, it's time
    to fix them.
    
    Note that, theoretically, this change may produce software error. Indeed
    the caller expecting a hashref (letter) will access the "content" key.
    But that should not happen.
    
    Test plan:
    Tests must return green

    Bug 18478 - Some notices sent via SMS gateway fail
    
    It seems that for HOLD and DUE (and maybe more) notices we rely on
    C4::Letters::SendQueuedMessages
    to populate the correct address.
    
    This patch adjust that subroutine to correctly populate the field and/or
    fail messages if no SMS provider available
    
    To test:
     1 - Define a messaging prefs for a patron to recieve hold notices via
     SMS
     2 - Ensure you have defined an SMS message for 'HOLD' letter
     3 - Set an SMS alert number for patron
     4 - Set the SMS::Send driver to 'Email'
     5 - Fill a hold for the patron
     6 - Check the db and note the address is null
     7 - run process_message_queue.pl
     8 - Check db - address is null and message pending
     9 - Apply patch
    10 - run process_message_queue
    11 - Message to_address should be populated and message sent

    Bug 18647: Resolve internal server error on category_type
    
    See bug 18552. When we resolved the housebound_role bug, the hash got
    filled correctly again. And this revealed that the (second) call to
    Koha::Patrons->find was not appropriate. It can be removed, as Jonathan
    explained on the report.
    
    Note: Commit 95429af6855e8ed37945b681dc466bf360deffb added this call, but
    it was hidden until the template variable hash got fixed.

    Bug 17898: Automagically convert SQL reports
    
    Bug 17196 move the marcxml out of the biblioitems table.
    That will break SQL reports using it.
    It would be handy to propose an automagically way to convert the SQL
    reports.
    
    We do not want to update the reports automatically without user inputs,
    it will be too hasardous.
    However we can lead the user to convert them.
    
    In this patchset I suggest to warn the user if a report is subject to be
    updated.
    
    TODO: Add a way to mark this job done (using a pref?) to remove the
    check and not to display false positives.
    
    Test plan:
    - Create some SQL reports (see https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library)
    - Go on the report list page (/reports/guided_reports.pl?phase=Use saved)
    - For the reports using biblioitems.marcxml you will see a new column
    warning you that it is obsolete
    - Click on update link
    => that will open a modal with the converted SQL query
    - Click on the update button
    => you will be informed that the query has been updated
    
    If all the reports are updated, the new column "Update" will no longer
    be displayed.

    Bug 18551 - Hide with CSS dynamic elements in member search
    
    In member search page, the result table is in Ajax so fully managed by Javascript. There is also a yellow dialog message prepared in HTML.
    
    Thoses elements are hidden by JS code : ie $("#patron_list_dialog").hide().
    
    The problem is that the static page is first loaded an displayed then the JS code runs an hides the elements.
    On a low performance computer, this action is visible and looks like there is a blinking yellow message.
    
    I propose to hide with CSS so that thoses elements are not displayed in static page and are there shown in dynamic JS code.
    
    Test plan :
    Check display is unchanged :
    - Go to home page /cgi-bin/koha/members/members-home.pl
    - Perform patron search from header search box
    - Perform patron search by clicking on a letter
    - Perform patron search from filters (left of results table)
    - Select a patron and add it to a list => you see the yellow message
    
    Yellow message does no longer appear with this patch.

    Bug 18536: Generating CSV using profile in serials late issues doesn't work as described
    
    Description on editing csv profiles says:
    
    "You can also use your own headers (instead of the ones from Koha) by
    prefixing the field name with an header, followed by the equal sign."
    
    So the header should be optional, but in fact it's mandatory. Also the
    regular expression to cut table name from beginning of db column is not
    right.
    
    Test plan:
    
    0. Don't apply the patch
    1. Make two CSV profiles for exporting late issues
        a) SUPPLIER=aqbooksellers.name|TITLE=subscription.title|ISSUENUMBER=serial.serialseq|LATE SINCE=serial.planneddate
        b) aqbooksellers.name|TITLE=subscription.title|ISSUE NUMBER=serial.serialseq|LATE SINCE=serial.planneddate
    2. Export late issues, profile a) works as expected, profile b) doesn't
    3. Apply the patch
    4. Both profiles should work

    Bug 17665 - SIP2 Item Information Response returns incorrect circulation status of '08' ( waiting on hold shelf ) if record has any holds
    
    If a record has any holds on it, the SIP2 item information response will

    Bug 18438 - Implemented data-dismiss="modal" in returns.tt so that any warning messages hidden by a hold modal are displayed after it is dismissed
    
    Test plan:
    1. Check out an item to one patron whilst having that item also being on
    hold to another patron
    
    2. Check the item back in
    
    3. Notice a modal box appears greying out the background with three
    buttons 'Confirm hold', 'Print and confirm' and 'Ignore'. Click confirm
    and notice that the page refreshes and no yellow warning messages are
    able to be displayed
    
    4. Now that you have checked the item in. Try checking it in a second
    time by clicking on the Checkin tab and writing in the barcode.
    
    5. The modal box will appear again, this time with three buttons
    'Confirm', 'Print and confirm' and 'Cancel hold'
    
    6. Click the 'Confirm' button and the page refreshes again and the
    yellow warning message hidden by the modal box is not properly displayed
    to the user. Notice that the focus is on the barcode input box.
    
    7. Apply patch
    
    8. Try checking in the item again, and this time after clicking the
    'confirm' button on the modal box notice that the yellow warning message
    is displayed telling the user the item was "Not checked out". Also
    notice the focus is in the barcode inputbox.
    
    9. Drop the hold on the item and make sure it is not checked out.
    
    10. Repeat steps 1 and 2 and notice after clicking the 'Confirm hold'
    button the page refreshes and the item is successfully checked back in.
    With the focus on the barcode input.
    
    11. View koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/circ/returns.tt and
    notice that the button on line 345 does not use an onclick parameter

    With plack, when creating a new authority framework from another, you get the error :
    Can't call method "prepare" on an undefined value at (...)/src/admin/auth_tag_structure.pl line 267.
    
    Looks like plack does not like when the var $dbh from the script is called inside a sub.
    
    This patch adds a local var $dbh inside sub duplicate_auth_framework(), like in sub StringSearch().
    
    Also correctes a redefine of my $sth.
    
    Test plan:
    - Go to Administration > Authority types
    - Create a new type
    - On this new type click on Actions > MARC Structure
    - Select another type and click OK
    => You must get a table filled with the tag structure
    Check with and without plack
    You may not be able to reproduce the error with plack.

    Bug 18571: Add default ES configuration to koha-conf-site.xml.in
    
    This patch adds a default configuration entry for elasticsearch. It will
    add localhost:9200 to the server subsection, and koha_instance (replacing instance
    for the corresponding instance name) for the namespace.
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patch
    - Copy the file to the /etc/koha dir:
      $ sudo cp kohaclone/debian/templates/koha-conf-site.xml.in /etc/koha
    - Create a new instance:
      $ sudo koha-create --create-db test
    => SUCCESS: /etc/koha/sites/test/koha-conf.xml includes the mentioned section:
    
     <elasticsearch>
         <server>localhost:9200</server>
         <index_name>koha_test</index_name>
     </elasticsearch>
    
    - Sign off :-D
    
    Note: As the use of ES is syspref driven, this default entry doesn't have any use
    until ES is installed and SearchEngine set to Elasticsearch. So it doesn't hurt
    but will help end users test the ES integration. Advanced users will take care of
    this config entry manually (pointing to external servers/clusters, etc).

    Bug 14399: Results form also needs a few interface changes
    
    Currently, the value of compareinv2barcd is used to determine if the
    Seen column, the Select/Clear all buttons and the Mark seen buttons are
    displayed. But if we scanned barcodes, we already marked items as seen.
    So we should only display these buttons when we did not upload barcodes.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Upload a barcode file. Check that the result form does not show
        the buttons.

    Bug 14399: Interface changes
    
    A part of the confusion around the inventory script may arise from the
    fact that the form offers several options that are only used under
    certain conditions. This patch hopefully rearranges a few options more
    logically and only offers options when appropriate.
    
    The barcode fieldset now also contains Compare barcodes and Do not check in
    checkboxes. These are meaningful when a barcode file is uploaded.
    
    The fieldset Item location filters (new name) contains fields that are
    always used. Same for tne only control left under Additional options,
    Export to CSV.
    
    The fieldset Optional filters depends on the status of the barcode file
    and the Compare checkbox. It is now shown or hidden depending on what
    you select: if you do not upload a file, it is shown; or if you upload
    a file and check Compare, it is shown. Otherwise we hide it, since the
    script will not look at these values. Under this fieldset last inventory
    date and Skip items on loan are added, since their behavior is the same
    as the various item statuses.
    
    Test plan:
    In this test plan we test both the script changes from the previous patch
    and the interface changes here. We follow the three main scenario's as
    mentioned in the previous patch.
    
    [1] First we prepare a few test items.
        Pick two biblios A, B and create five items say A1,A2,B1,B2,B3.
        Pick a not-existing callnumber range you want to test and move these
        five items there. Add barcodes too (say A1..B3).
        Edit one item A1 to a not-existing notforloan status (doing this on
        the mysql command line is fastest).
        Like: update items set notforloan = '9' where barcode='A1';
        Now simulate that we did not add/edit these items today:
        update items set datelastseen='2017-01-01' where barcode in ('A1','A2','B1','B2','B3');
        Note: We need this when comparing with last inventory date in the last
        scenario.
    
    Scenario 1 (no barcodes uploaded)
    [2] Enter the callnumber range on inventory form.
        Verify that "Set inventory date", Compare barcodes and "Do not check
        in" are disabled on the form. Check that you see the Optional filters
        box.
        Submit the form. Verify that you see all five items.
        Do the same. Check Export to CSV. Check result file contents.
    
    Scenario 2 (upload barcodes, do not compare)
    [3] Create a barcode file with the barcodes of A1, A2 and B1. Add another
        existing barcode outside the test callnumber range.
        After uploading this file, verify that "Set inventory date", Compare and
        "Do not check in" are enabled. The Optional filters should be hidden.
        Leave "Set inventory date" to today. Enter the callnumber range again.
        Submit the form.
        What do we expect? Four items should have been updated (alert). We
        should see barcode A1 with problem Unknown status. We should see
        also the barcode from the other range (Found in wrong place).
        Repeat this step with the same file. But now export to CSV. Verify that
        you see two barcodes with problems again in the csv file.
    
    Scenario 3 (upload barcodes, compare)
    [4] Create another barcode file with barcodes of B2 and one existing barcode
        outside the test callnumber range.
        After uploading this file, check the Compare checkbox. Verify now that
        the Optional filters box is displayed again.
        Leave "Set inventory date" to today. Enter the callnumber range again.
        Also set "Last inventory date" to today (important!).
        Submit the form.
        What do we expect now? Two items should be updated (see alert).
        We should see barcode B3 with problem Missing. We should also see the
        barcode from the other range (wrong place).

    Bug 14399: Numerous small refinements to the inventory script
    
    This patch contains the following changes:
    
    [01] Label "Inventory date" reworded to "Last inventory date", adding a
    small explanation for its purpose.
    [02] Restructured the results: it was an array with items and possible
    error messages. Multiple messages duplicated individual items. Now the
    results are in a hash, pulling all error messages for one item together.
    At the end of the script they are copied to an array. (A helper sub
    additemtoresults is added in this regard.) We no longer use array
    @items_with_problems.
    [03] Both datepickers are no longer connected to the same class. This
    prevents changing the set date by filling the last inventory date.
    [04] Input markseen in the template and $markseen in the script are
    no longer needed.
    [05] The paragraph before the detail link in the results table in the
    Title column has been removed. Same for problems column. This makes
    vertical spacing consistent.
    [06] Problem status 'missingitem' is no longer used; the missing items
    are marked as 'not_scanned'. Two additional statuses are: no_barcode and
    checkedout.
    [07] Removed unused $itemtype, $totalrecords and $count. We use variable
    $moddatecount to report a count to the template.
    [08] The script updated scanned items twice. The first time with ModItem
    and the second time with ModDateLastSeen. The second call is removed.
    [09] If a book is checked in, we do no longer return an error message when
    the checkin is successful (ERR_ONLOAN_RET). The updated datelastseen is
    passed to the results.
    [10] $wrongplacelist is renamed to $rightplacelist. It is only built when
    we need it. (Same for inventorylist now.)
    [11] Datelastseen (last inventory date) is always used for building the
    inventory list. It allows you to process partial barcode lists or make
    a list of items not seen after some date. We do no longer use variable
    $paramdatelastseen.
    [12] The section where items.datelastseen was compared with the inventory
    date has been removed. Scanned items were already updated; to get items
    seen before some date, you can now use last inventory date without passing
    barcodes.
    
    The form can mainly be used for the following three cases:
    [1] Prepare an inventory list or csv file; we do not upload barcodes.
    [2] Update items for uploaded barcodes without comparing to inventory.
        Last inventory date is useless in this case.
        Errors wrongplace, checkedout and changestatus are reported.
        Use this scenario for partial scanned barcode lists (all but last).
    [3] Update items for uploaded barcodes and compare to inventory, filtered
        by an optional last inventory date.
        Apart from the errors mentioned under [2], this also reports
        not_scanned ("missing") and no_barcode.
        Use this scenario too for the last partial barcode file (together with
        inventory date).
    
    Test plan:
    See next patch ("Interface changes").

    Bug 14399: Prevent display of double zero notforloan status
    
    On bug 12913 a zero status is added on the inventory form. This prevents
    a lot of false warnings for a wrong notforloan status. The zero status
    is not included in the default setup. But if you would add one, the
    status will display here twice now.
    
    This patch checks if the status already exists.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Add a zero NOTFORLOAN status if it does not yet exist in Authorized
        values.
    [2] Check that you do not see two "For loan" statuses on inventory form.

    client
    2) Notice callnumber sits under the library name
    3) Go to the detail page of the same biblio in OPAC

    Bug 18314: Account lockout
    
    To prevent brute force attacks on Koha accounts, staff and opac, we need to
    implement an account lockout process to Koha.
    
    After a number of failed login attempts a users account would become locked.
    The user would then need to use the reset password functionality to send a reset
    token to their email account. After a successful password reset the lockout flag
    would be removed.
    
    The number of failed login attempts before lockout is configurable using a new
    system preference 'FailedLoginAttempts'.
    
    How does it work?
    When a patron enter an invalid password, the borrowers.login_attempts value
    for this patron is incremented. When this value reach the value of the
    pref FailedLoginAttempts, the password comparison is not done and the
    authentication is rejected.
    This login_attempts field is reset when a patron correctly logs in. When
    the account is locked the patron has to reset his/her password using
    the OpacResetPassword feature or ask a staff member to generate a new
    password.
    If the pref is not set (0, or '') the feature is considered as disabled,
    but the failed login attempts are stored anyway.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Apply patch and execute the update DB entry
    1/ Switch on the feature by setting FailedLoginAttempts to 3
    2/ Use an invalid password to login at the staff or OPAC interface
    3/ After the third consecutive failures, you will be asked to reset your
    password if OpacResetPassword is set, or contact a staff member
    4/ Switch on OpacResetPassword and reset your password
    5/ Confirm that you are able to login
    6/ Play with the different combinations
    
    QA details: The trick happens in C4::Auth::checkpw, to make things clear
    I had to create a return value (note the awesome name: @return) and
    replace the 3 successives if statements with elsif. Indeed if one of
    the condition is reached, it will return inside the given block.

    Bug 15705: Reset the last error when an auto renew successes
    
    The auto_renew_error has to be reset when an auto renew successes,
    otherwise the patron is not going to receive the correct notice.
    
    Test plan;
    - Checkin an item and mark it as auto renewal (specify a due date in the past to allow auto renewals)
    - Set OPACFineNoRenewalsBlockAutoRenew to 'Block' and 'OPACFineNoRenewals' to '1'
    - Execute the script
    => Auto renewed, column auto_renew_error is null
    - Add a fine of '2' to the patron
    - Execute the script
    => Not auto renewed, column auto_renew_error is 'auto_too_much_oweing'
    => On the interface youo see the correct message "Automatic renewal failed, patron has unpaid fines"
    - Pay the fine
    - Execute the script
    
    Without this patch the auto_renew_error is not reset and the patron is going to
    receive a letter telling him he own too much money to the library
    With this patch the patron will receive a letter to inform him the renew has been done!

    Bug 15705: Notify the user on auto renewing
    
    When an issue is auto renewed, a notice will be sent to the patron.
    The notice will tell if the renewed has been successfully done.
    
    Note that this patch is not ready to be pushed yet, as it has some
    defects:
    - 1 notice per issue
    - no way to disable the notice generation
    - no way to specify patron categories to enable/disable the
      notifications
    
    Test plan:
    Use the automatic_renewals.pl script to auto renew issues.
    If the auto renew has failed or succeeded, a notice will be generated in the
    message_queue table.
    If the error is "too_soon" or is the same as the previous error, the
    notice won't be generated (we do not want to spam the patron).

    Bug 15582: Ability to block auto renewals if OPACFineNoRenewals is reached
    
    If a patron owes more than the OPACFineNoRenewals value, the issue won't
    be auto renewed anymore (driven by the new pref OPACFineNoRenewalsBlockAutoRenew).
    
    Test plan:
    Note: You will have to manually change data in your DB, make sure you
    have access to the sql cli.
    1/ Set the OPACFineNoRenewals to 5 (for instance)
    2/ Set OPACFineNoRenewalsBlockAutoRenew to block
    3/ Check an item out to a patron and mark is as an auto renewal
    4/ Make sure the patron does not have any fees or charges.
    5/ Execute the automatic renewals cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/automatic_renewals.pl)
    Confirm that the issue has been renewed
    6/ Create an invoice for this patron with a amount > OPACFineNoRenewals (6
    for instance)
    7/ Execute the automatic renewals cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/automatic_renewals.pl)
    Confirm that the issue has not been renewed.
    8/ Set OPACFineNoRenewalsBlockAutoRenew to allow
    9/ Execute the automatic renewals cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/automatic_renewals.pl)
    Confirm that the issue has been renewed

    Bug 17762: Add the new TranslateNotices syspref
    
    This whole patch set adds the ability to translate notices in different
    languages.
    That way, if a library has patrons from different countries, they will
    not have to send the notices in only one language but they will be able to
    translate them.
    
    Test plan:
    - Switch on TranslateNotices
    - Translate the interface in different languages
    - Edit patron's details
    => You should see a new "prefered language" entry
    That language will be used to send notices to this patron
    - Edit several notice templates
    => You should see different tabs, 1 tab per language translated at the
    opac (which sounds to make sense)
    - Now the notice generated for this patron should be the one translated
    in the language picked for him
    To confirm that, try to generate several notices for this patron.
    If the notice is not translated, the default one should be used.

    Bug 17942 - Update style of the web installer with Bootstrap 3
    
    This patch makes style and markup changes to the web installer and new
    onboarding tool (Bug 17855).
    
    - Markup has been corrected, improved, and in many places reindented.
    - Some page titles have been made more specific.
    - Some JavaScript and CSS have been moved to separate files.
    
    In the onboarding tool I have removed form validation from the markup
    and JavaScript in many cases where the requirements were not matched
    elsewhere in Koha. For instance, we shouldn't limit item type
    descriptions to only letters because the database doesn't require such a
    limit.
    
    To test, apply the patch and run the web installer with an empty
    database. Confirm that the installation process completes correctly and
    that each page looks good and works correctly.
    
    Works as advertised

    Bug 16515 - Did you mean? links don't wrap on smaller screens
    
    This patch tweaks some CSS in the OPAC to give the "Did you mean" block
    better layout on smaller screens.
    
    To test, apply the patch and process LESS files. Enable "Did you mean"
    plugins for the OPAC in Administration.
    
    Perform a search in the OPAC and confirm that the "Did you mean" block
    looks correct. Resize your browser to various widths and confirm that
    the block handles all sizes well.

    Bug 18529 - Template cleanup of patron clubs pages
    
    This patch addresses template issues with the newly-added patron clubs
    pages.
    
    - Move Clubs tab out of second position in Circulation page tabs.
    - Link patron name in enrollments list to the patron record
    - Make page titles on some pages more specific
    - Correct label "for" attributes so that it matches input id
    - Correst style of buttons: Buttons in tables must be "btn-xs," all
      Bootstrap buttons must have "btn-default."
    - Correct "Edit" icons: Should be "fa-pencil"
    
    This patch also revises the club template editing form to make it more
    consistent with similar interfaces in Koha and (hopefully) make it more
    clear.
    
    To test, apply the patch and test adding clubs and club templates and
    enrolling patrons in clubs via the staff client and OPAC. Confirm that
    everything looks and work okay.

    Bug 18400: [QA Follow-up] Move sort outside the loop
    
    GetItemTypesCategorized can return descriptions that are still undef since
    Authorized values does not enforce a description in lib and lib_opac.
    When I add one ITEMTYPECAT auth value without descriptions, I can still
    generate the string comparison warnings on the itemtypes sort.
    In order to prevent the warning, we should add an empty string in the
    assignment on line 229.
    
    We do not need to copy the itemtypes hash if we move the sort outside the
    @advanced_search_types foreach. There is no need to sort it more than once.
    Note that I did not see any reasons btw for corruption of the structure
    inside this loop.
    
    Note: If we use ITEMTYPECAT without descriptions, we should probably leave
    them out. No need to show a checkbox without description on Advanced Search,
    but I would recommend to solve that on its own report. The whole ITEMTYPECAT
    functionality has imo not been designed properly.

    Bug 16758 - Caching issues in scripts running in daemon mode
    
    As L1 cache does not have expiration mechanism, scripts running
    in daemon mode (rebuild_zebra.pl -daemon, sip server ?, ...) would
    not be aware of any possible changes in the data being cached
    in upstream L2 cache.
    
    This patch adds ->flush_L1_caches() call in rebuild_zebra.pl
    inside daemon mode loop.
    
    To test:
    
    1) apply patch
    2) ensure that rebuild_zebra.pl -daemon is still working properly,
    without any noticeable performance degradation
    3) stop memcached daemon and try to run rebuild_zebra.pl -daemon
    again: there should be a warning emitted stating that the script
    is running in daemon mode but without recommended caching system

    Bug 18574 - Clean Patron Records tool doesn't limit to the selected library
    
    The library selector simply does nothing because at some point the
    javascript that powers it was removed. This is very bad because
    the librarian may batch delete patrons assuming it is limiting by
    branch correctly and instead delete patrons for all the libraries!
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Note that the library pulldown on tools/cleanborrowers.pl does nothing
    2) Apply this patch
    3) Note that chaning the value in the pulldown now refreshed the page and sets the library correctly!

    Bug 12063: Change date calculation for reserve expiration to skip all holiday
    
    This patch makes koha automatically set expiration date when reserves become
    waitting. Also it adds a new syspref "ExcludeHolidaysFromMaxPickUpDelay" that allows to
    take holidays into account while calculating expiration date.
    
    Test plan:
    
      - Install this patch and run updatedatabase.pl script,
      - allow ExpireReservesMaxPickUpDelay in system preferences,
      - set ReservesMaxPickUpDelay to 5.
    
      - Place an hold on a checked out item and check in this item:
        The hold's expiration date should be today + 5.
    
      - Allow ExcludeHolidaysFromMaxPickUpDelay in system preferences,
      - add holiday during this pickup delay period,
      - Create a new hold and make it comes waitting:
        The hold's expiration date should be today + 5 + number of closed
        day(s).
    
    Also:
      - Check that ExpireReservesOnHolidays syspref works again
        without ExcludeHolidaysFromMaxPickUpDelay.
      - Check that cancel fees apply again if wanted.

    - Improved performance of database queries especially for large
      collections.
    
    - Unified functionality of ListRecords and ListIdentifiers to a common
      base class.
    
    - If items are included in the records, their timestamps are taken into
      account everywhere so that whichever is the most recent (timestamp of
      biblioitem or any of its items) is considered the record's timestamp.
    
    - Fixed OAI.xslt to show correct record range.
    
    - Incorporated extended tests from Bug 17493 and their tweaks from Bug 15108.

    Bug 18098: Add an index with the count of not onloan items
    
    This patch adds a numeric index 'not-onloan-count' containing the value
    of 999$x. This subfield is filled by 'rebuild_zebra.pl' by making use of
    (bug's 18208) 'EmbedItemsAvailability' filter.
    
    bib1.att and indexes definitions are updated accordingly.
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patch
    - Pick the right biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl file for your setup and
      replace the one your Zebra uses [1]
    - Replace your bib1.att
    - Replace your ccl.properties
    - Have at least one record with more than one item, checkout some
      item(s) from that record(s).
    - Rebuild zebra's indexes:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev
     k$ cd kohaclone
     k$ misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -r -b -v -k
     (notice the dump directory is kept, you can try the XSLT yourself
      running:
        $ xsltproc \
           etc/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl \
           /tmp/the_dump_dir/biblios/exported_records | less
    => SUCCESS: There are records with the not-onloan-count index, and the
                value is correct!
    - Check Zebra yourself:
      $ yaz-client unix:/var/run/koha/kohadev/bibliosocket
     Z> base biblios
     Z> find @attr 1=9013 @attr 2=5 @attr 4=109 0
    => SUCCESS: The search matches the amount of records with not-onloan
                items.
     Z> s 1+1
    => SUCCESS: Records with 999$x having a value higher than 0 are rendered
    - Sign off :-D
    
    Note: While this work is complete on its purpose, it is part of an
    attempt to create a better way of filtering by availability.

    - Open any patron account in circulation.
    - Expand the "Checkout settings" panel.
    - Click the label or checkbox for "Automatic renewal", "Don't

    Bug 7550: [QA Follow-up] Resolve param warning from sco-patron-image
    
    Resolve this warning:
      CGI::param called in list context from package C4::Service line 212, this can lead to vulnerabilities. See the warning in "Fetching the value or values of a single named parameter" at /usr/share/perl5/CGI.pm line 436.
    
    It comes from the require_params call in sco-patron-image.pl.
    
    Git grepping on require_params tells me this:
      members/default_messageprefs.pl:my ($categorycode) = C4::Service->require_params('categorycode');
      opac/sco/sco-patron-image.pl:my ($borrowernumber) = C4::Service->require_params('borrowernumber');
      opac/sco/sco-patron-image.pl:my ($csrf_token) = C4::Service->require_params('csrf_token');
      svc/cataloguing/metasearch:my ( $query_string, $servers ) = C4::Service->require_params( 'q', 'servers' );
    
    The only candidate for multi_param seems to be 'servers', but as we can see
    this variable is a scalar. Additional servers returned by require_params are
    lost. This should be solved on its own report.
    So, we can safely add scalar to the params call, resolve the warning and
    keep the same behavior.

    Bug 7550: SCO - Restrict access of patron's image
    
    With this patch if SelfCheckoutByLogin is set to 'username and
    password', only the logged in user will be able to see the image linked
    to his/her logged in account.
    If set to "barcode" we generate a token but it can be easily generated.
    You should add a warning in the about page if
    SelfCheckoutByLogin="barcode" and ShowPatronImageInWebBasedSelfCheck="Show".
    
    How I tested:
    - Go to SCO
    - Log - Enable self checkout, go to [Your
      Server]//cgi-bin/koha/sco/sco-main.pl
    - Log in with a user 'A' who has a patron image
    - Copy the address of the patron image into an other browser window
    - Change the borrowernumber to on of an other user 'B' having a patron
      image
    - Verify that the patron image is NOT displayed

    Bug 17952 - Lost items not skipped by overdue_notices.pl
    
    If a library does not use --mark-returned when running longoverdue.pl,
    all those lost item checkouts are selected by overdue_notices.pl.
    This causes much unnecessary overhead. In addition Koha::Calendar is
    instantiated many times for each branchcode which is not necessary.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Run overdue_notices.pl, note output
    2) Apply this patch
    3) Run overdue_notices.pl again, note output is the same

    Bug 18152 : fix unimarc label in SetMarcUnicodeFlag
    
    The standard UNIMARC requires than the 9th character (starting from 0) in
    labels must be blank (while it may be 'a' in marc21)
    
    the problem is that C4::Charset::SetMarcUnicodeFlag (called in particular when
    we import a record) always add 'a' char in the 9th label'pos whereas it should
    do it just for MARC21 and NORMARC (not for UNIMARC) :
    
    C4::Charset::SetMarcUnicodeFlag add 'a' char in the 9th label character for
    MARC21 and NORMARC (it's normal), but just before doing this it call
    "$marc_record->encoding('UTF-8')" which is a MARC::Record function which, when
    called with 'UTF-8' parameter, do only one thing : add 'a' char in the 9th
    label character
    
    This patch only removes this incorrect function call, so, when we import a bib
    record in UNIMARC : it no longer adds erroneous character (this does not change
    anything for MARC21 and NORMARC because SetMarcUnicodeFlag explicitly adds 'a'
    char in the 9th label for them)

    2. Clear memcached
    
    3. Go through the installer (to speed up this test plan install all
    sample data so you dont have to create libraries, patron categories etc. later)
    
    4. On the installer page login as the database user and notice that it
    does not work on the first attempt ( you get 'Error: You do not have
    permission to access this page')
    
    5. Try logging in as database user for a second time and notice you are
    logged in successfully this time
    
    4. In staff interface create a patron account with superlibrarian permissions
    
    5. Logout of the staff interface
    
    6. Login as database user
    
    7. Notice you cant log in. You get the 'Error:: You do not have permission to access this
    page' error
    
    8. Try a second attempt and notice you get the same error
    
    9. Open the URL in a new tab and notice the staff interface appears
    showing that you are logged in
    
    10. log out and log back in as the superlibrarian user you created and
    notice it works on first login attempt
    
    11. Apply patch
    
    12. Log out and try logging back in as database user and notice that you
    can login successfully on first attempt
    
    13. Repeat steps 1,2,3 and login as database user and notice the login
    works on first attempt

    Bug 18502: Make koha-shell set the right PERL5LIB on dev installs
    
    Bug 16749 introduced a nice way to have flexible paths. During the discussion on how to do it, we moved from having it contain the path to the git dir to just a boolean. The 'koha-shell' script didn't get attention it seems, and it is broken on dev installs.
    
    This was hidden by the fact that many of us run dev installs on kohadevbox, which sets a .bashrc file for de instance's user, containing the right path when opening the new shell.
    
    This patch changes the logic so on a dev install, intranetdir is picked as the right path. This is how it is handled in koha-functions.sh
    
    To test:
    - On kohadevbox, run:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev -c "perl misc4dev/populate_db.pl"
    => FAIL: C4/Installer.pm not found on PERL5LIB error.
    - Apply this patch
    - Replace /usr/bin/koha-shell with debian/scripts/koha-shell
      $ sudo cp kohaclone/debian/scripts/koha-shell /usr/bin/koha-shell
    - Run:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev -c "perl misc4dev/populate_db.pl"
    => SUCCESS: No warning about missing libs is raised.

    Bug 16344: Add a circ rule to limit the auto renewals given a specific
    
    This patch adds a new circulation rule (no_auto_renewal_after_hard_limit) to block/allow
    auto renewals after a given date.
    The idea is to stop renewals at a given date. That way the library will have
    time to send overdues and get the books back before the students do on holiday.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Execute the update DB entry
    1/ Define a rule with no_auto_renewal_after_hard_limit set to tomorrow
    2/ Modify the issues.issuedate, to simulate a checkout in the past:
        UPDATE issues
        SET issuedate = "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
        WHERE itemnumber = YOUR_ITEMNUMBER;
    with issuedate = 2 days before for instance
    3/ Execute the automatic renewals cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/automatic_renewals.pl)
    Confirm that the issue has been renewed
    4/ Modify the no_auto_renewal_after_hard_limit and set it to yesterday
    5/ Execute the automatic renewals cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/automatic_renewals.pl)
    Confirm that the issue has not been renewed

    Bug 14224: Allow patron notes about item shown at check in
    
    This patch adds a "Note" input field to checked out items in the "your summary"
    section. The field allows patrons to write notes about the item checked out,
    such as "this DVD is scratched", "the binding was torn", etc. The note will be
    emailed to the library and displayed on item check in.
    
    Patch adds two fields to the "issues" table - "note" and "notedate".
    Patch adds syspref "AllowIssueNotes" - default off.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Update database
    3) Rebuild schema
    4) Turn on 'AllowIssueNote' syspref
    5) Check out three different items to a borrower (may be easiest to check
        out to yourself)
    6) Log in as that borrower (or yourself) on the OPAC side and go to your
    summary
    7) Confirm text field shows under Note column for all checkouts. Set a
    note for each issue, confirm all save.
    8) Check the message_queue in mysql for the entries for ALL THREE issue
    notes.
    9) Disable javascript in your browser
    10) Refresh your summary page. Confirm that you can no longer edit the
    notes in the text field. Click the 'Create/edit note' button and confirm
    you are redirected to a new page.
    11) Confirm that the correct title and author show for the note button
    you clicked.
    12) Set the note and click Submit -> confirm you are redirected
    back to summary page and note is saved
    13) Confirm there is a new entry in message_queue
    14) Enable javascript and go back to the your checkouts page in the
    staff client for the borrower you issued the items to
    15) Check in TWO items
    16) Confirm that the issue notes show under the "Date due" column for
    the two items you checked in, and are accurate to the item (i.e. the
    right issue note under the right item)
    17) Go to circ/returns.pl and check in the final item using the barcode.
    Confirm the issue note shows and the date is formatted correctly.

    Bug 18484 - opac-advsearch.tt missing closing div tag for .container-fluid
    
    This patch corrects HTML validation errors by adding back a missing
    </div> which was removed accidentally by Bug 9043 (2014!).
    
    This patch also removes "border" attributes from <img> tags because the
    attribute is obsolete.
    
    To test, apply the patch and test the validity of the OPAC's advanced
    search page. The only error should be one about 'Bad value
    "api-server,"' which isn't really resolvable.

    Bug 12461 - Add patron clubs feature
    
    This features would add the ability to create clubs which patrons may be
    enrolled in. It would be particularly useful for tracking summer reading
    programs, book clubs and other such clubs.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Run updatedatabase.pl
    3) Ensure your staff user has the new 'Patron clubs' permissions
    4) Under the tools menu, click the "Patron clubs" link
    5) Create a new club template
       * Here you can add fields that can be filled out at the time
         a new club is created based on the template, or a new enrollment
         is created for a given club based on the template.
    6) Create a new club based on that template
    7) Attempt to enroll a patron in that club
    8) Create a club with email required set
    9) Attempt to enroll a patron without an email address in that club
    10) Create a club that is enrollable from the OPAC
    11) Attempt to enroll a patron in that club
    12) Attempt to cancel a club enrollment from the OPAC
    13) Attempt to cancel a club enrollment from the staff interface
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 17855: Simplify the onboarding tool
    
    This patch should not modify a lot the behaviours of the onboarding
    tool.
    Its goal is mainly to remove duplicated as well as useless (because
    copy/pasted from existing script files) code.
    
    It assumes that the onboarding tool will be done on an empty database
    and will skip steps that are not needed. For instance if a library
    already exists, the first step will be skipped.
    
    One of the main problem was the lack of feedback messages sent to the
    user when something wrong/ok happened.
    
    Explanation on main changes:
    1. Use checkauth first, then get_template_and_user
    => As we do not know the template to use, it's better to use checkauth
    first to know if the user is logged in, then retrieve the template we
    need, depending on the success or the failure of the action
    2. Create a @messages variables
    Pushing messages to this variable and handling the messages via an
    include files (onboarding_messages.inc) simplify error handling. Note
    that we could remove this include file if we merge all the
    onboardingstepX.tt files altogether
    3. Simplify creation of the admnistrator user
    This patch removes some unecessary checks done on the user's info
    (passwd to short, mandatory fields
    
    Todo (minor): Add style to feedback messages

    Bug 13835: Popup with searches: results hidden by language menu in footer
    
    Language menus in pop up windows are not necessary and can hide the contents
    (especially search results) on a narrow screen.
    
    For an example, see screenshot in comment #3
    
    This patch allows to mark pop p menus not to display the language footer.
    
    To test:
    
    - Reproduce issue from comment #3
    - Apply patch
    - Try to reproduce issue from comment #3
      -> language menu should no longer display
    - Verify that language menu is suppresed in 'Add to ist' as well
      (from catalog search results, select an item, Add to:...)
    
    Note: There will be more pop-ups with unwnated language selector.
          That can be resolved in follow up bugs.
    
    Followed test plan which worked as intended

    Bug 18479 - Holds 'Placed on' column in opac-user.pl not sorting correctly
    
    Two columns in the user's holds table in the OPAC do not sort correctly
    because they are not marked up correctly to enable date sorting: 'Placed
    on' and 'Expires on.' This patch corrects it.
    
    This patch also removes a stray </td> which was causing validation
    errors.
    
    To test, apply the patch and log into the OPAC with an account which has
    multiple holds with differnt hold dates and expiration dates. Confirm
    that sorting on these columns works correctly.

    Bug 17916 - "Delete MARC modification template" fails to actually delete it
    
    The MARC modification templates' 'Delete' button fails because the event
    handler has a "preventDefault" but the outcome of the confirmation
    function must return true or false.
    
    This patch removes the "preventDefault" from the .delete_template click
    handler as well as a redundant onclick attribute from the delete link
    itself.
    
    To test, apply the patch and go to Tools -> MARC modification templates.
    Clicking the delete button for any existing template should work
    correctly.

    Bug 18419 - Broken patron-blank image in viewlog.tt
    
    Because of a variable name collision the blank patron image doesn't
    display in viewlog.tt. This patch moves the image from the template to
    the stylesheet to avoid this problem.
    
    This patch also replaces the blank patron image PNG file with an SVG
    file. SVG support is wide enough to begin using whereever possible.
    
    This patch also removes some inline CSS from circ-menu.inc and puts it
    in the global stylesheet.
    
    To test, apply the patch and clear your browser cache if necessary.
    
    - Enable the patronimages system preference.
    - View a patron account which lacks a patron image. All views (details,
      fines, notices, etc) should show the "blank" patron image, including
      the modification log view.
    - View a patron account which has a patron image and check that it still
      displays correctly in all views.

    This patch adds a few lines that check for a rental fee on an item. If
    yes, it will show in brackets as a rental fee on the OPAC summary page.
    
    To test:
    1) Have a borrower with an overdue item accruing fines, a lost item and
    an item with a rental fee. Confirm the Fines column on the OPAC summary
    page now shows you what you may expect to see for each item.

    Bug 18179: Forbid list context calls for Koha::Objects->find
    
    Reading https://perlmaven.com/how-to-return-undef-from-a-function
    this sound like the more correct behaviour.
    
    Considering:
    $template->param(
        stuff => Koha::Stuffs->find( $id ),
        foo   => 1,
    );
    without this patch, if the $id does not represent any rows in the DB,
    stuff will be assigned to 'foo' and $foo will be undef in the template.
    That can lead to very bad side-effects.
    
    With this patch we make sure that it will never happen again.

    If SMS via Email is enabled, and a patron has opted for SMS messages, but has not selected a service provider, the cronjob will die with the error
    Can't call method "domain" on an undefined value at /usr/share/koha/lib/C4/Letters.pm line 1055.
    This will cause all messages that come after the error to not be sent!

    2) Enable SMS for a patron, but don't set a provider

    Bug 18409: Make the controller for holds use Koha::Holds
    
    Recently, there's been a major fix on the REST api swagger spec,
    which involved fixing boolean values so they are actually booleans
    and Koha::Object was extended to handle that.
    While the swagger spec for this endpoint got fixed, such is not the case
    with the implementation (the controller class).
    
    This patch fixes this situation by:
    - Specifying boolean properties as boolean in the schema file
    - Fixes the controller so it returns Koha::Hold objects instead of the
      hashref returned by GetReserve, which is wrong.
    - Better (than empty) descriptions are added to 'suspend',
      'suspend_until' and 'lowestPriority' on the spec.
    
    To test:
    - Run:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev
     k$ cd kohaclone
     k$ prove t/db_dependent/api/v1/holds.t
    => FAIL: Tests fail, mostly due to error 500 results.
    - Apply this patch
    - Run:
     k$ prove t/db_dependent/api/v1/holds.t
    => SUCCESS: Tests pass!
    - Sign off :-D
    
    This can also be tested using any interface for REST apis.
    
    Note: This endpoint lacks several of the new guidelines and is not
    complete (there's no GET for single holds, etc). It is also missing
    exception handling. There are probably
    other bug reports for that, just thought it was worth mentioning.
    
    Followed test plan and this patch worked as intended

    Bug 18300: [QA Follow-up] Fix return value inconsistency
    
    As noted on bug report 17669, the return values of delete (both singular
    and plural), delete_missing and delete_temporary should be consistent.
    
    Removed the if-construction around full_path. We do not need it; in the
    very exceptional case that full_path would be empty, we should delete
    the record since the file is missing.
    
    Adjusted POD and unit tests accordingly.

    Bug 18300: Delete missing upload records
    
    If you deleted files from the upload directories manually, or you rebooted
    with files in the temporary upload folder, or for some other reason have
    records without a file, you may want to cleanup your records in the
    uploaded_files table.
    
    This patch adds the method delete_missing to Koha::UploadedFiles. It also
    supports a keep_record parameter to do a dry run (count the missing files
    first).
    
    Also, we add an option --uploads-missing to cleanup_database. If you add
    the flag 1 after this option, you will delete missing files. If you add the
    flag 0 or only use the option, you will count missing files.
    
    A subtest is added to Upload.t for delete_missing tests.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Upload.t
    [2] Upload a file and delete the file manually.
    [3] Run cleanup_database.pl --uploads-missing
        It should report at least one missing file now.
        Check that the record has not been deleted.
    [4] Run cleanup_database.pl --uploads-missing 1
        It should report that it removed at least one file.
        Check that the record is gone.

    Bug 18182: Make TestBuilder capable of returning Koha::Object
    
    This patch adds a new method to t::lib::TestBuilder so it can return
    Koha::Object-derived objects. The new method is called ->build_object
    and requires the plural of the target class to be passed.
    
    'class' is a mandatory param, and a warning is raised and undef is
    returned if absent.
    
    It accepts 'value' as the original ->build() method, and that is passed as-is
    to ->build().
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patches
    - Run:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev
     k$ cd kohaclone
     k$ prove t/db_dependent/TestBuilder.t

        Verify that the oldest are gone (depending on the value chosen).

        If all uploads are gone now, add a new one with Tools/Upload.

    Bug 17669: Introduce new preference for purging temp uploads
    
    The new preference is: Upload_PurgeTemporaryFiles_Days.
    It controls if the cron job will delete temporary uploaded files and if so,
    how many days should have passed before doing so.
    
    Since the default value is empty, it will not start deleting these uploads
    until you change the pref. No behavior change. But the dbrev will print a
    message if you already have temporary uploads.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Check Administration, Preferences, Tools for the new pref.
    [2] Run the db rev.

    Bug 16895 - Allow writeoffs via SIP2
    
    Many SIP2 services such as those by Comprise Technologies are able to or
    require that an ILS be able to accept writeoffs via SIP2. The SIP2
    protocol specifies that payment type be a two digit number, but does not
    specify a code for writeoffs. To this end we should allow the write-off
    code to be specified in the SIP2 config on a per-account basis so that
    if different vendors use different fixed codes for write-offs we can
    handle that gracefully.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Modify your SIP2 config to include
          payment_type_writeoff="06"
      in the login portion of the account you will be using for the test.
    3) Restart your SIP2 server
    4) Create a fee for a patron
    5) Send a SIP2 fee paid message specifying the payment type code we
       defined earlier, with a payment amount that is *not* equal to the
       amount outstanding for the fee.
    6) Note the fee paid response indicates the payment failed
    7) Repeat step 5, but this time send the amount outstanding as the
       payment amount
    8) Note that the fee paid response indicates a successful payment
    9) Note in Koha that the fee has been written off!

    Bug 10357: Adding link for email notification for new subscription issues to opac-detail
    
    This patch adds the link to the opac-detail.pl page so it is less hard
    to find.
    Update: Fixing link to look like button, adding span ID around element
    Update: Changing ID to Class
    Update: Comment 14 fixes
    
    To test:
    1) Add a subscription, attach it to a record and select a notice under
    'Patron notification'. Hit Next, fill in some fields and save the
    subscription
    2) Go to that record detail page in the OPAC. Go to the subscriptions
    tab, click 'More details'. Notice how many clicks it takes to see the
    'Subscribe' button
    3) Apply patch and go back to the details page for the record
    4) Notice now there is a 'subscribe' button
    5) Confirm this button works as expected and you are redirected to
    the detail page
    6) Confirm 'Cancel' works and redirect works too
    7) Go down to 'More details' and confirm the buttons work and you are
    redirected back to the serial-issues plage from here

     - make sure syspref AutomaticItemReturn is false
     - check 'Return policy' in 'Default checkout, hold and return policy'
     - make a SIP2 checkout and checkin from a branch different than item's home branch.
     - verify that SIP2 response gives alert CV04 (=send to different branch)
     - also verify that response field CT gives correct branch according to 'Return policy'

    Bug 17814: koha-plack --stop should make sure that Plack really stop
    
    koha-plack --stop doesn't ensure that Plack was really stopped before
    returning
    
    So in case that koha-plack --stop was quickly follows by koha-plack
    --start (e.g. logrotate), it could leave Plack in stop state. This is
    due to koha-plack --start think that Plack was already started, while it
    actually is being stopped.
    
    For me I think this is the cause why I got random Plack stop when
    logrotate is run.
    
    It should be similar to the case of Zebra in Bug #16885, and the
    solution might be the same: adding "--retry=TERM/30/KILL/5;" to
    start-stop-daemon command.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
    1) Login to staff client and do something that will hold connection for
    a long time, e.g. a batch import or a slow report.
    2) sudo koha-plack --stop mykoha
    3) ps aux | grep plack   <-- a Plack process will still running work in
    1)
    4) wait for 1) to finish and all Plack processes exit
    5) sudo koha-plack --start mykoha
    6) apply the patch
    7) repeat step 1)-2)
    8) ps aux | grep plack   <-- There should be no Plack process running
    now
    9) Note that work in step 1) might get terminated midway. Since we force
    Plack to stop after some wait.

    Bug 18364: Do not LOCK/UNLOCK tables from tests
    
    From the MySQL doc:
    "LOCK TABLES is not transaction-safe and implicitly commits any active transaction before attempting to lock the tables."
    If the LOCK/UNLOCK statements are executed from tests, the current transaction will be committed.
    To avoid that we need to guess if this code is execute from testsa or not (yes it is a bit hacky)
    
    Better ideas are welcome!
    
    Another fix would have been to revert

    Bug 18372 - transits are not created at check in despite user responsing Yes to the prompt
    
    If the AutomaticItemReturn system preference is set to "Don't" and you
    check in an item which belongs to another library, a dialog will ask you
    if you want to transfer. This patch corrects a bug to enable the "Yes"
    buttons to work, triggering the transfer.
    
    To test, apply the patch and check in an item which belongs to another
    library. In the dialog, click the 'Yes' button and confirm that the item
    has been made 'in transit' to the correct library.
    
    Perform the same test with the 'Yes, print slip' and 'No' buttons and
    confirm they are working correctly.
    
    Since this patch changes the behavior of many other popups triggered
    from this template, test other operations which trigger a 'print slip'
    option like:
    
    - Checking in an item which is part of a rotating collection
    - Checking in an item which is on hold for a patron

    Switch on both ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts and SwitchOnSiteCheckouts
    
    Do a regular checkout

    What we need is definitely to add a second condition on the join.

    Bug 17835: Create a ItemtypeLocalization view
    
    To properly move C4::Koha::GetItemTypes to Koha::ItemTypes we need
    DBIx::Class to make a join on the localization table to retrieve the
    possible translated description of the item types.
    To do so there are 2 possibilities. The first one would have been to
    rename the localization table to something like itemtype_localization.
    That way we could have had a relationship between
    itemtype_localization.code and itemtypes.itemtype
    That would have meant to create one table per "entity" (here an entity
    is itemtype) we allow the translability. There are pros and cons for
    this choice, so I opt for another solution.
    The other solution is to create a view on top of this localization
    table. With this new view we can define the missing relationship.
    
    That sounds like a quite clean solution and easy to implement.
    Once we have this relationship, the
    Koha::ItemTypes->search_with_localization will join on this view an
    return the same result as GetItemTypes( style => 'array' ).
    To replace
        GetItemtypes( style => 'hash' )
    which is the default behavior of this subroutine, we can do something like:
        my $itemtypes = Koha::ItemTypes->search_with_localization;
        my %itemtypes = map { $_->{itemtype} => $_ } @{ $itemtypes->unblessed };
    
    This patchset must not introduce big changes but it changes certain
    behaviors (which were wrong) in some scripts. Indeed sometimes the
    descriptions of the item types were not the translated ones. Moreover it
    happens that the item types displayed in a dropdown list were not
    ordered by translated description, but by description of code
    (itemtypes.itemtype value). These 2 behaviors are what we expect.
    
    Test plan:
    Bugs will be hard to catch since these patches change a lot of file, it
    will be easier to read the diff and catch possible typos or logic
    errors.
    However signoffers can focus on modified files and the item types
    values.

    Intranet search results displays due date from item onloan.
    This should use the TT date plugin.

    Bug 9988: Refactor the cron script
    
    The cron job is moved from migration tools to cronjobs. And renamed to
    a plural form. The script is now based on Koha objects. It does no longer
    include the code to merge one record. This can be done via the interface,
    and will be added to a maintenance script on bug 18071. Should not be part
    of this cron job.
    
    Adding a cron_cleanup method to MergeRequests; this method is called from
    the cron script to reset older entries still marked in progress and to
    also remove old processed entries. Tested in a separate unit test.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Authorities/MergeRequests.t
    [2] Set AuthorityMergeLimit to 0. (All merges are postponed.)
    [3] Modify an authority linked to a few records.
    [4] Delete an authority linked to a few records with batch delete tool.
    [5] And select two auth records with linked records.
        Merge these two records with authority/merge.pl.
        Note: Do not select Default. See also bug 17380.
    [6] Check the need_merge_authorities table for inserted records.

    Bug 9988: Few subtle changes for postponed merge
    
    The fails in the previous test showed that we need the first three
    changes here. Some final polishing in points 4 to 6.
    
    [1] Sub merge: Refine the condition for initializing $tags_new.
        A postponed 'modify'-merge (A to B) makes that $authtypefrom is not
        defined when running merge later. When crossing the type boundary, we
        need a new field too.
    [2] Sub merge: Add condition for an empty @record_to array.
        This indicates also that a field should be removed, since we should
        otherwise only add a $9 subfield.
    [3] Sub merge: Adjust initializing @record_from.
        This change is tested by verifying a cleared subfield in the test.
    [4] DelAuthority: Adding a skipmerge parameter to allow the call from
        authorities/merge.pl to skip an unneeded merge.
        This also prevents that the 'delete-merge' would precede the
        'modify-merge' under a hypothetical race condition.
    [5] DelAuthority: There is actually no need to call GetAuthority.
        The subfields of the old record are not relevant in this case.
    [6] Added a few POD lines to merge.
    [7] Removed a trailing space in a comment line in merge.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Authorities/Merge.t.
        The last subtest should no longer fail now.
    [2] See test plan of next patch.

    Bug 9988: Remove further references to dontmerge
    
    [1] The preference was sent to HEA. We can now send both AuthorityMergeMode
        as well as AuthorityMergeLimit.
    [2] A comment in authorities/merge.pl is removed. Note that a subsequent
        patch will modify and test the cron job.
    [3] Script misc/batchRebuildItemsTables.pl temporarily enabled dontmerge.
        This is equivalent to setting the mergelimit to zero.
        The function defnonull is no longer needed. (If the pref was NULL,
        we restore that value. Sub merge won't mind.)
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/UsageStats.t
    [2] Run misc/batchRebuildItemsTables.pl -t
        This just ensures you it still compiles; the changes speak for itself.
    [3] Now git grep on dontmerge.
        You should only find hits in atomicupdate and misc/translator/po.

    Bug 9988: Check the merge limit in sub merge
    
    At this point, we are replacing dontmerge functionality by the new
    AuthorityMergeLimit logic. Instead of doing this check before calling
    merge, we just call merge and check it there. In order to let the cron
    job do the larger (postponed) merges, we add a parameter override_limit.
    
    A subtest is added in Merge.t to test the 'postponed merge' feature. Since
    merge now also calls get_usage_count, an additional mock is added. All
    references to dontmerge are removed.
    
    In merge two lines, initializing $dbh and $counteditbiblios, are moved.
    The dontmerge test in DelAuthority and ModAuthority is removed. Since this
    did not leave much in ModAuthority, I fixed the whitespace on the remaining
    lines rightaway (yes, I know).
    A minimal set of changes is applied to the cron script; it will get further
    attention on a next patch.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Authorities/Merge.t
    [2] Set AuthorityMergeLimit to 2. Modify an authority with two linked
        biblios. Check that the merge was done immediately.
    [3] Now modify an authority with more than 2 linked records.
        Verify that the merge was postponed; a record must be inserted in
        the need_merge_authorities table.
    [4] Testing of the merge cron job is *postponed* to a next patch.
        Note: I tested a modification, but the script just needs more
        attention.

    Bug 9988: Remove the Zebra code from sub merge
    
    Since we can now call linked_biblionumbers, we can now remove all Zebra
    related code from merge. We also add a parameter biblionumbers; we use it
    in the test now, but it may be handy too later in the maintenance script
    when we want to trigger a merge for specific biblionumber(s). See bug
    report 18071.
    
    All mocks for ZOOM, Context::Zconn, Search::new_record_for_zebra in the
    merge test can now be replaced by one mock for linked_biblionumbers. Note
    that we test the biblionumbers parameter in the last subtest without that
    mock.

    Bug 9988: Add get_usage_count and linked_biblionumbers to Koha::Authority
    
    When replacing the Zebra code in sub merge, we actually need CountUsage
    as well as the results it gets from SearchEngine.
    
    In order to get count and/or results, we now create:
    
    [1] instance methods get_usage_count and linked_biblionumbers in
        Koha::Authority,
    [2] class methods of the same name in Koha::Authorities.
    
    The instance method calls the class method. The class method can be used
    for deleted authority records, and in 'legacy calls' before refactoring.
    
    Note: On BZ 18149 we will replace all CountUsage calls.

    Bug 17737: Replace GetReservesFromItemnumber with Koha::Item->get_holds_placed_before_today
    
    On the same way of Koha::Biblio->get_holds,
    Koha::Biblio->get_holds_placed_before_today and Koha::Patron->get_holds,
    this new subroutin will permit to retrieve the holds placed on a
    specific item.
    Note that at the moment we do not need a Koha::Item->get_holds method:
    we do not want to display future holds placed in the future.
    
    Test plan:
    I would suggest to test this patch with patches from bug 17736 and bug 17738,
    to place different kind of holds (biblio and item level, future and
    past).
    Then do a whole workflow to detect bug, view a record, delete record,
    order, place a hold on an item which has been ordered, etc.
    The hold's informations should always be the same without or without
    these patches.

    Bug 17872: Fix small error in GetBudgetHierarchy and one of its calls
    
    In aqbudgetperiods.pl a commented line is removed that contains a
    wrong userenv hash key. Should be branch instead of branchcode.
    
    In aqbudgets GetBudgetHierarchy is called with the same wrong userenv
    hash key. Should be userenv->{branch}.
    This made another bug visible: if you call GetBudgetHierarchy with a
    branch and without owner, the where clause should take into account
    that the branchcode can be empty (not null).
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run Budgets.t
    [2] Run aqbudgets.pl from Administration
    [3] Add the show_mine=1 parameter in the URL

    Bug 14932 - serials/serials-collection.pl-page is very slow. GetFullSubscription* checks permission for each serial!
    
    Currently we have subscriptions with 300+ serials received.
    It takes a lot of time to show serials-collection.pl (~20s).
    This is especially troublesome when receiving serials, since after receival we get redirected to that page.
    
    We no longer can receive daily serials in the allotted timeframe.
    
    This quick and dirty fix prevents checking the subscription editing for each serial, but instead checks it for the first serial only.
    
    This reduced page load time by ~18s
    
    TEST PLAN:
    1. Receive ~300 serials (or just a bunch :)  )
    2. Observe the gradual slowing of the receival action.
    
    AFTER THIS PATCH:
    1. Receive ~300 serials more (or just a bunch)
    2. Observe a significant performance improvement.

    stored in the Issues table (which is the holding branch) when calculating the new due date.
    
    This patch replaces using the branch from the Issues table with the branch
    specified by the HomeOrHoldingBranch syspref.
    
    To test:
    1. Set up 2 branches, Branch1 and Branch2
    2. Set up a loan rule in Branch1 for DVDs with a 21 day loan period and a
       21 day renewal period.
    3. Set up a loan rule in Branch2 for DVDs with a 14 day loan period and a
       14 day renewal period.
    4. Checkout a DVD belonging to Branch1 while logged into Branch2. It will
       receive the correct 21 day loan period.
    5. Renewing the same DVD while logged into either Branch1 or Branch2
       will give a 14 day due date, rather than 21 days.
    6. Checkout a DVD belonging to Branch2 while logged into Branch1. It will
       receive the correct 14 day loan period.
    7. Renewing the same DVD while logged into either Branch1 or Branch2
       will give a 21 day due date, rather than 14 days.
    8. Apply the patch and repeat steps 4-7. The correct due date should be given
       when the item is renewed, regardless of where it is checked out or renewed.
    
    This update removes reassignment of $branch variable.

    Bug 17825: Remove the use of AttributeTypeExists from opac-user.pl
    
    With the introducion of Koha::Object-based
    Koha::Patron::Attribute::Type(s) there's no need for using this
    function.
    
    This patch replaces it with a regular ->search + ->count call.
    
    To test:
    - Have a user with checkouts logged into the OPAC on the opac-user.pl
    page
    - Set the SHOW_BCODE attribute to 'no' on the staff interface for the
    user.
    - Reload opac-user.pl
    => SUCCESS: The barcode is not shown for checked out items.
    - Set the SHOW_BCODE atttribute to 'yes' on the staff interface for the
    user.
    - Reload opac-user.pl
    => SUCCESS: The barcode is shown for checked out items.
    - Delete the Patron attribute type SHOW_BCODE
    - Reload opac-user.pl
    => SUCCESS: No barcode is shown for checked out items
    - Sign off :-D

    Bug 17828: Overload Koha::Patron::Attribute->store to check for unique_id and repeatable
    
    This patch introduces a Koha::Patron::Attribute->store method that does
    the required check for the corresponding Koha::Patron::Attribute::Type
    and raises an exception if trying to store more than one unique
    attribute code/value combination, and another exception for
    non-repeatable attribute types being stored while already existing on
    the DB.
    
    This patch introduces exception definitions for that purpose.
    
    To test:
    - Apply the unit tests patches
    - Run:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/Koha/Patron/Attributes.t
    => FAIL: Tests fail

    Bug 17014 - Remove more event attributes from patron templates
    
    There are many patron-related templates which still use event attributes
    to define events. This patch updates these templates so that events are
    defined in JavaScript.
    
    To test apply the patch and check out to a patron.
    
    - From the Print menu in the toolbar, choose "Print summary." The patron
      summary page should open and the print dialog should be automatically
      triggered.
    
    - From the Print menu in the toolbar, choose "Print slip." The patron
      slip page should open and the print dialog should be automatically
      triggered.
    
    - From the Print menu in the toolbar, choose "Print quick slip." The
      patron quick slip page should open and the print dialog should be
      automatically triggered.
    
    - Click the patron's "Fines" tab in the left-hand sidebar and then
      choose the "Account" tab.
      -- Click the "Print" button for an account payment (the link should
         point to printfeercpt.pl). A print receipt page should open and
         the print dialog should be automatically triggered.
      -- Follow the same procedure for a transaction which is not an account
         payment (the link should point to printinvoice.pl).
    
    - Click the "Create manual invoice" tab.
      -- Select one of the "type" choices. Doing so should automatically
         populate the "Description" field with the corresponding code.
      -- If necessary, define one or more values for the MANUAL_INV
         authorized value and confirm that those invoice types work as well.
    
    - From the patron's "Pay fines" tab, click the "Pay amount" button. In
      the "collect from patron" field, enter any combination of letters,
      numbers, and symbols. When you tab away from that field your text
      should be reformatted to currency format.
    
    - From the patrons home page, change the filter in the left-hand sidebar
      and submit it. The correct results should be returned.

    Bug 18304: Do not mail cart or list contents to the library
    
    Sometimes we receive mails from patrons, sent from opac-sendbasket or
    opac-sendshelf. Instead of placing a hold on books they send the contents
    of the cart (or even a list).
    
    This patch simply puts a note on both forms saying that they should not
    use the mail to request or renew books. If both options are disabled on
    the OPAC, the message is not shown.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Enable RequestOnOPAC.
    [2] Put a book in the cart.
    [3] Open the cart, click on Send. Verify presence of the message.
    [4] Open a list.
    [5] Click on Send list. Verify presence of the message.

    Bug 18200: Fix a potential issue with preceding space in GetMarcUrls
    
    Trims the URL in order prevent prefixing a space with http://
    Normally you won't have a preceding space here, but I saw it happening
    one day and it does not cost much to resolve it.
    
    Bonus: Adding few simple tests in t/db_dependent/Biblio.t.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Biblio.t
    [2] Add a 856$u with preceding space (MARC21)
    [3] Check opac-detail, Online access with OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay empty.

    Bug 18174: Add update to Koha::Object
    
    Since Koha::Objects has a update method, we should allow it too in
    Koha::Object. Note that it is just redirecting to DBIx immediately.
    
    Changed the exception when the method generates an error. The previous
    code suggested that the method was not found, but this is not the case.
    
    Test plan:
    Run t/db_dependent/Koha/Object.t

    Bug 16757 - Add ability to pay fee by id for SIP2
    
    The SIP protocol allows for a Fee Paid message to specify a fee
    identifier in the CG field. While this field is read and passed to
    C4::SIP::ILS::pay_fee, it is not passed along to
    C4::SIP::ILS::Transaction::FeePayment::pay and is thus not used. We
    should enable this functionality in Koha now that accountlines each have
    a unique identifier that can be passed along to the payment requestor
    via the AV field line items added by bug 14512.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Create a fee in Koha
    2) Ensure your SIP2 server is running and configured correctly
    3) Send a 37 Fee Paid message to Koha's SIP server with the
       accountlines_id for that fee in the CG fee identifier field,
       along with the other required fields.
    4) Note that specific fee was paid in Koha

    Bug 15541 - Prevent normalization during matching/import process
    
    This patch allows you to use the "qualifier,qualifier" syntax
    in the Record Matching Rules "Search Index" when using the QueryParser.
    While QueryParser doesn't support this syntax, it will now fallback
    correctly to non-QueryParser functionality. Without the patch, your search
    will just fail silently.
    
    This patch also adds a "skip_normalize" option to C4::Search::SimpleSearch(),
    and uses the option during C4::Matcher::get_matches. This prevents
    the s/:/=/g and s/=/:/g normalization. This normalization is heavy-handed,
    and while it is necessary sometimes to generate a valid CCL query or
    QueryParser query, C4::Matcher::get_matches() already produces a valid
    CCL query, so we don't need to do this normalization.
    
    Additionally, this normalization causes problems when you use a
    Zebra register which isn't normalized: namely the "u" register.
    Strings are stored "as is", so http://localhost/koha/resource/1 is
    stored as is during indexing. When you search, you need to pass
    the exact same thing through the query to get a match. Using
    http=//localhost/koha/resource/1 in your query will yield zero results.
    
    _TEST PLAN_
    
    0) Apply patch
    
    1) Create a Record Matching Rule in Koha with the following details:
        Matching rule code: TEST
        Description: Test
        Match threshold: 100
        Record type: Bibliographic
        Match point 1:
            Search index: id-other,st-urx
            Score: 100
            Tag: 024
            Subfields: a
            Normalization rule: None
    2) Create a record in Koha with an indexable URI
        2a) Default framework
        2b) 024 $a http://koha-community.org/test $2 uri
        2c) 040 $c test
        2d) 245 $a This is a test record
        2e) 942 $c Books
        2f) Save (save again if cautioned about missing fields as these should autofill)
    3) Do a full re-index of Zebra
    4) Download your record from Koha as a .mrc file (ie isomarc, binary marc, etc)
    5) Go to "Stage MARC records for import"
        5a) Upload your .marc file.
        5b) Change your "Record matching rule" to "Test"
        5c) Click Stage for import
    9) It should say "1 records with at least one match in catalog per matching rule "Test".
    
    NOTE: For completeness, you can go through this process on a clean master branch,
    and note that it will say '0 records with at least one match in catalog per matching rule "TEST"'

    Bug 17233 - Add 008 value builder plugin for MARC21 classifications
    
    This patch adds 008 cataloguing value builder for MARC21 classifications
    records (LCC, DDC/Dewey, UDC and so on).
    
    For most practical purposes, MARC21 classification records
    (<https://www.loc.gov/marc/classification/>) are quite similar to regular
    MARC21 authority records, so handling them in Koha is (almost) achievable
    by means of the built-in 'regular' MARC21 authority records related
    functionalities, but there are some notable differences - in particular,
    008 field length and format is not the same.
    
    To test:
    
    1) apply patch
    2) link the new plugin (marc21_field_008_classifications.pl) to the 008
    field in the existing (or cloned, ..) authority framework of your choice
    3) try to add, edit, re-edit 008 field using this "authority" framework,
    ensure that the new plugin behaves as it should according to the
    Library of Congress specifications for MARC21 classification records
    008 field format (<https://www.loc.gov/marc/classification/cd008.html>).

    Bug 18307 - Branchname is no longer displayed in subscription tab view
    
    This patch restores the branchname in OPAC subscription detail view.
    Additionally, it adds the subscriptons count to the tab title to make
    it consistent with the other tab titles.
    
    To test:
    - Search a subscription in OPAC catalog
    - Go to Subscriptions tab (see screenshot in initial comment)
    - Verify that library name does not display
    - Apply patch
    - Verify that library name displays properly in Subscriptons tab
    - Verify that the tab title displays the subscriptions count
      e.g.: Subscriptions (2)

    Bug 18209 - Patron's card manage.pl page is not fully translatable
    
    The headers of the tables displayed in patroncards/manage.tt are hardcoded in the .pl and thus cannot be translated.
    
    This simple fix reuse the translate_card_element tool already in the code to make the strings translatable.
    
    Applied patch and verified that table headers on manage.pl display the same as before.

    Bug 17866: Change sender for serial claim notifications
    
    Currently, the From field uses the emailaddress of the staff client member
    from the user context. This is exceptional in Koha. And might very well be,
    as in our case, the cause of fraud detection warnings.
    We should use branch email address or fallback to KohaAdminEmailAddress,
    as we do (almost) everywhere else.
    
    Test plan:
    Go to subscription detail in Koha.
    Go to Claims.
    Select a missing issue and click Send notification.
    Verify the sender address in the generated notification. (Make sure that
    you receive this mail.)

(The error was: {UNKNOWN}: DBD::mysql::db begin_work failed: Already in a transaction at /usr/share/perl5/DBIx/Class/Storage/DBI.pm line 1560. at /home/koha/src/C4/Biblio.pm line 3468 , see the Koha log file for more information).
    
    Looks like it is because of Bug 18242 which added a transaction  in C4::Biblio::_koha_delete_biblio_metadata : $schema->txn_do.
    The script batch_delete_records created a transaction with $dbh->{AutoCommit} = 0;
    
    This patch fixes by using also Koha::Schema in batch_delete_records to manage transaction.
    It also removes "$dbh->{RaiseError} = 1", this behavior is managed in Koha::Database.
    
    Test plan :
     - Go to Staff interface : Tools > Batch record deletion
     - Enter a few existing biblionumbers
     - Click on "Continue"
     - Click on "Delete selected records"
    => Without patch you get a DB error
    => With patch you get confirmation message
     - Try to get the biblios to confirm they are deleted : /cgi-bin/koha/catalogue/detail.pl?biblionumber=xxx
     - Test with and without Plack

    Bug 12913: [QA Follow-up] Reword 'change item status' and add zero status
    
    The zero status should be added in @notforloans. It is a legitimate status
    for available books. The zero status description can be translated in
    the template.
    The 'Change item status' is confusing. We mean that we saw a notforloan
    status that we do not expect (read: does not exist in the table).

    Bug 12913 - wrong inventory results when notforloan filter is not used
    
    In inventory tool, there is a test on scanned items notforloan value : if the value is not one of authorized values, the inventory results displays the problem "Change item status".
    The bug is that if notforloan filter is not used, the notforloan values array is not filled and so all scanned items are marked with this problem.
    
    Test plan :
    - Check you have in default framework an item subfield mapped with items.notforloan and with an authorized value catergory, for example 'NOTFORLOAN'
    - Check the authorized value category has at least value '0'
    - Create a new value in this category, for example '9'
    - Create a biblio with default framework
    - Create an item with barcode='000AAA1', callnumber='ZZZAAA1' and notforloan=0
    - Create an item with barcode='000AAA2', callnumber='ZZZAAA2' and notforloan=9
    - Delete new value created above, for example '9'
    - Create a file 'barecodes.txt' containing 2 lines '000AAA1' and '000AAA2'
    - Go to inventory tool : /cgi-bin/koha/tools/inventory.pl
    - Choose file in 'Barcode file'
    - Enter item callnumber between 'ZZZ' and 'ZZZZ'
    - Check 'Compare barcodes list to results'
    - Submit
    => without patch, you get 2 results with problem 'Change item status' even for item with notforloan=0
    => with patch, you get 1 result with 'Change item status' on item with notforloan=9

    Bug #6979
    
    I removed several lines of code in the checkpw_ldap subroutine where
    LDAP authentication takes place, in the "else" part of the conditional
    that checks for the auth_by_bind config parameter. I added several lines
    to check whether the user can log in to LDAP using their DN and the
    password supplied in the login form. If they are able to bind, login
    contiues as normal and the LDAP attributes can be harvested as normal if
    the update options are turned on. The routine that was in place was
    failing because it was trying to check against a non-existent LDAP entry
    attribute called 'userpassword'. Instead of checking against a
    'userpassword' attribute, the routine really should be checking to make
    sure the user can actually bind to LDAP. That's what I set up, and it is
    a safer way to test authentication against LDAP.

    Bug 17560: Hold fee placement at point of checkout
    
    Currently, Koha charges all patrons a hold fee in all circumstances, if
    a hold fee is applicable to their patron category.
    This is immediately applied at point of request.
    However, it would be useful to let patrons make requests without a
    charge
    being incurred until they physically have the item in their hands and
    checked out to their cards.
    
    The hold fee will only be added to the account  as soon as the item is
    checked out to the requesting patron.
    With this scenario, we will be certain that patrons have the correct
    item, and they are happy with what has been supplied.
    It also means that patrons can place holds via the OPAC without reaching
    the usage limit that has been selected.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ All the following steps must be done with a patron using a patron category with a hold fee
    1/ Make sure that the existing options for HoldFeeMode work as before
    2/ Select the third option "any time a hold is collected"
    3/ Place a hold on an item
    4/ Note that the patron has not been charged
    5/ Check this item from the staff interface
    6/ Note that the patron has been charged
    7/ Place another hold
    8/ Use the self checkout feature at the OPAC for the checkin
    9/ Note that the patron has been charged and a message is displayed to
    inform about the fee.

    Bug 17736: Replace GetReservesFromBiblionumber with Koha::Biblio->holds
    
    The C4::Reserve::GetReservesFromBiblionumber took 3 parameters, the
    biblionumber, an optional itemnumber and a "all_dates" flag.
    If set, the subroutine returned all the holds placed on a given bibliographic
    record, even the ones placed in the future. Almost all of the calls had this
    flag set, they will be replaced with a call to Koha::Biblio->holds.
    
    But 5 did not have it:
    - C4::Biblio::DelBiblio
    -tools/batch_delete_records.pl
    => These 2 were wrong, we want to retrieve the holds to cancel them
    before deleting the record. We need to get all the holds, even the ones
    placed in the future /!\ CHANGE IN THE BEHAVIOR
    
    - acqui/parcel.pl
    => 1 call per item were made to this subroutine. They have been replaced
    with only 1 call to the new method Koha::Biblios->holds_placed_before_today
    Then we filter on the itemnumbers.
    I think this is wrong: we need the number of holds to know if the record
    can be deleted, so even if future holds exist, the deletion should not
    be possible.
    
    - serials/routing-preview.pl
    - C4::ILSDI::Services::GetRecords
    - C4::SIP::ILS::Item->new
    => Seems ok, we just one to display holds placed before today
    
    Test plan:
    I would suggest to test this patch with patches from bug 17737 and bug 17738,
    to place different kind of holds (biblio and item level, future and
    past).
    Then do a whole workflow to detect bug, view a record, delete record,
    order, place a hold on an item which has been ordered, etc.
    The hold's informations should always be the same without or without
    these patches.

    Since I did not find any use of this field.
    I guess it can be removed safely.
    
    There is no proper test plan here. Just make sure this field has never
    been used.

    I have not found any use of issues.return or old_issues.return. In
    all my live instances the column is always NULL. Issuing and returning
    seems to work as expected after the columns have been removed.

    Bug 15498: Let the user choose the CSV profile to export circ history
    
    The way the export options are displayed at the bottom of the checkouts table
    was not consistent.
    Prior to this patch set, they are display if ExportRemoveFields or
    ExportWithCsvProfile is set.
    It does not make any sense, the user could want to export the checkouts in
    iso2709 format without having to define a csv profile and fill the pref.
    
    Moreover the behavior of this pref did not match its description: it's used as
    a default CSV profile when exporting records from the export tools or the
    command line.
    
    This patch set adds a new pref ExportCircHistory and remove
    ExportWithCsvProfile. The new pref is set if ExportWithCsvProfile or
    ExportRemoveFields were set.
    A new dropdown list with the CSV profile list will be displayed in the
    export area, at the bottom of the checkouts table.
    
    Note that now --csv_profile_id is mandatory for the export command line
    (misc/export_records.pl) if the export format is csv.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Do not execute the DB entry
    1/ Clear both ExportWithCsvProfile and ExportRemoveFields prefs
    2/ Execute the DB entry
    3/ ExportCircHistory should not be set and the export options should not
    be displayed at the bottom of the checkouts table.
    4/ Remove the pref
      DELETE FROM systempreferences WHERE variable='ExportCircHistory';
    and reinsert the previous one, with a value:
      INSERT INTO systempreferences (variable, value) VALUES
      ('ExportWithCsvProfile', 'something');
    Execute the DB entry again
    => The now pref should be now set
    5/ Export some checkouts using the CSV entry
    6/ Note that the export tool and commandline script still work using the
    csv format. You have to provide a --csv_profile_id option to make it
    work.

    Bug 17971: TT syntax for notices - Add support for plurals
    
    On of the awesome things we will be able to do with the TT syntax is the support of plurals.
    
    For instance we will be able to send a list of items, checkouts, etc. to the notice template.
    That way we will get rid of our custom syntax like <<items.content>> or <item></item> for instance.
    
    The existing code already has the playground for that but it is not used.
    
    Basically the idea is to add a "loops" key which can contain a list of
    object to retrieve from the DB and send to the template.
    For instance:
        loops => { overdues => [ $itemnumber_1, .., $itemnumber_N ] }
    
    will send a variable "overdues" to the template. It will contain the
    Koha::Checkout objects relative to the id passed.
    
    There is one quite big inconvenient to this approach so far: since we
    are still supporting the historical syntax, the objects can be fetch by
    a script, then the script will send the id to GetPreparedLetter which
    will refetch them.
    This must be improved, but I suggest to do that later.
    
    Test plan:
      prove t/db_dependent/Letters/TemplateToolkit.t
    should return green

    Bug 17970: Fix GetPreparedLetter behavior if nothing to substitute
    
    From C4::Letters::GetPreparedLetter:
    
        my $tables = $params{tables};
        my $substitute = $params{substitute};
    
        $tables || $substitute || $repeat
           or carp( "ERROR: nothing to substitute - both 'tables' and 'substitute' are empty" ),
              return;
    
    So if the parameter tables or substitute is passed but does not contain anything, it will not warn as expected.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Apply the patch with tests
    2/ Confirm that they do not pass
    3/ Apply this patch
    4/ Confirm that the tests now pass

    Bug 17963: TT syntax for notices - Prove that AR_* are compatible
    
    Nothing new here since bug 17962, the AR_* notice messages are quite
    simple. They send the article_request, patron, biblio, biblioitem, item and
    library linked to the article request.
    
    All the fields from these 6 tables should still be accessible using the
    TT syntax.
    
    Test plan:
    Define TT notice templates for AR_PENDING, AR_PROCESSING, AR_COMPLETED
    or AR_CANCELED.
    
    You should manage to create a template to generate the same result as
    the historical syntax.

    Bug 18269: Move field mappings related code to Koha::FieldMapping[s]
    
    The 3 subroutines GetFieldMapping, SetFieldMapping and
    DeleteFieldMapping from the C4::Biblio module were only used from the
    field mappings admin page.
    They can easily replaced with new packages Koha::FieldMappings based on
    Koha::Object[s]
    
    Test plan:
    Add and delete field mappings (admin/fieldmapping.pl, Home ‚Ä∫
    Administration ‚Ä∫ Keyword to MARC mapping).
    Add an existing mapping > Nothing should be added
    
    Note that this page has not been rewritten and you will not get any
    feedbacks, but it's not the goal of this page to improve it.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 14146: Add the ability to cumulate restriction periods
    
    At the moment the default behaviour is not to cumulate the restriction
    periods but to apply the longest one.
    This patch set creates a new syspref CumulativeRestrictionPeriods. If
    on, the behaviour changes and the restriction periods are cumulated: the
    days of the second restriction are added to the actual restriction
    period.
    
    We could add a new circulation rule instead of a syspref, but I am not
    sure it's very useful to have such granularity for this behaviour (can
    be changed if needed).
    
    How it works:
    Let's take 2 items, A and B.
    A is returned with Na days late, and B Nb days late
    The grace period is Ng and there is 1 day of suspension charge per day
    of overdue
    The suspension period is until day D = Na - Ng + Nb - Ng
    
    I would have expected D = Na + Nb - Ng but it's how it worked before
    this patch.
    
    Test plan:
    Create several overdue for a given patron
    Do the checkins and confirm that the period are added if the pref is on.
    If the pref is off, you should not get any changes in the existing behaviour.

    Bug 17847: Replace C4::Koha::GetAuthvalueDropbox with Koha::AuthorisedValues
    
    The C4::Koha::GetAuthvalueDropbox subroutine does the same job as
    Koha::AuthorisedValues->search
    We should then replace the different calls to this subroutine to finally
    remove it.
    There were 2 calls to this subroutine:
    - from the AuthorisedValues TT plugin (called from av-build-dropbox.inc
    and members/housebound.tt)
    - from the acqui/ajax-getauthvaluedropbox.pl ajax script
    
    To make sure that this patchset does not introduce regressions, we will have
    to test that the TT plugin and the ajax script still behave as before.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Test acqui/ajax-getauthvaluedropbox.pl
    - Link a fund to an authorised value category
    - Create a new order
    => When you select a fund linked to AV category, the sort1 (and/or
    sort2, depending on what you set) should be replaced with a dropdown
    list populated with the authorised values
    2/ Test av-build-dropbox.inc
    - Create some authorised values for Bsort1
    - Edit a patron
    => The sort1 should be a dropdown list populated with the Bsort1 AV
    3/ Test members/housebound.tt
    - Enable the housebound module (pref HouseboundModule)
    - On the patron detail page, click on the "Housebound" tab
    => The frequency dropdown list should be populated with the different
    HSBND_FREQ AV

    Bug 17844: Replace C4::Koha::get_notforloan_label_of with Koha::AuthorisedValues
    
    This patch is more a bugfix than a refactoring.
    Indeed the C4::Koha::get_notforloan_label_of behaviors were buggy:
    1/ It does not display the opac description at the OPAC, but always the
    staff description
    2/ It does not care of the framework of the biblio, but retrieve the
    first row of the marc_subfield_structure mapped with items.notforloan
    
    These 2 bugs can easily be fixed using the
    Koha::AuthorisedValues->search_by_koha_field
    
    Steps to recreate the issues:
    - Create 2 authorised value categories for not for loan (NFL1 and NFL2)
    with the same values. Define a different description for the OPAC.
    - Define link 952$7 to NFL1 for the default framework and to NFL2 for
    the BK framework
    - Create 2 bibliographic records (B1 using NFL1 and B2 using NFL2) with
    2 items each (1 item should have a not for loan value)
    - Go to the "Place a hold" view for this record.
    - In the item list, you should see the not for loan value
    => The staff description of NFL1 will always be used, even for the OPAC
    
    Test plan:
    - Recreate the issues without this patchset
    - Apply this patchset
    - Recreate the steps to recreate the issues
    => The staff description of NFL2 should be displayed for the B2 item
    => The opac description of NFL2 should be displayed for the B2 item at
    the OPAC

    borrower_message_preferences cannot be truncated because of the foreign.
    DBMS fails with
      "Cannot truncate a table referenced in a foreign key constraint"
    
    To avoid that we should remove the FK check and truncate the other table

    Bug 13757: (QA followup) Make opac-memberentry.pl handle attrs deletion
    
    The original code on this bug skipped empty-valued attributes. But
    emptying attributes is the only way to tell the controller script that
    the user wants to delete them.
    
    This patch makes opac-memberentry.pl check the existence of attributes
    sharing the code of the empty for the given patron, and it stores the
    deletion on the Koha::Patron::Modification as needed. Otherwise
    deletions got skipped.
    
    To test:
    - Verify setting/deleting attributes that are opac-editable and verify
    the results are sound.

    Bug 13757: Make Koha::Patron::Modification->store del empty attrs
    
    This patch makes Koha::Patron::Modification->store delete the passed
    attributes that contain empty values.
    
    This is the way it currently works, as all opac-editable attributes are
    presented to the end-user and they are allowed to delete them, and the
    best way I found to represent the deletion on the modification request
    is by setting it to the empty string. I chose this way because it is how
    the staff interface handles it, so it is consistent.

    Bug 13757: (followup) Only touch opac_editable attributes
    
    As reported by Owen, the members-update.pl was showing every attributes
    the patron has (display issue) instead of showing only those affected by
    the changes.
    
    This patch fixes this by filtering the patron's attributes by opac
    editability.
    
    It also fixes Koha::Patron::Modification->approve so it only clears the
    attributes with the updating 'code' and leaves the others untouched.
    As its been coded so far (until someone refactors it all) the
    Koha::Patron::Modification object needs to contain all the attributes
    for a specific code. And it comes from parsing the UI's input.
    
    Tests for Koha::Patron::Modification->approve to come.

    Bug 13757: (followup) Staff interface changes
    
    This patch adds proper extended attributes display and handling on the
    patron modifications moderation page (members-update.pl).
    
    It also adds changes checking to the opac-memberentry.pl page so it
    only saves a modification request if there are changes (it only checked
    regular fields and not the extended ones).

    Bug 13757: Add the option to set patron attributes editable in the OPAC
    
    Note: this is a squashed version of the original patchset, because it was needed
    
    This patch adds an opac_editable property of borrower attribute types
    that can be set in the interface. I'm removing work on OPAC and will
    refactor it, keeping the author attribution.
    
    Test plan:
      1. Repeat the following with a new and existing borrower attribute
         type:
      2. Verify that "Editable in OPAC" can only be checked if "Display in
         OPAC" is checked.
      3. Verify that this new property is correctly saved.

    Bug 17792: Add opac_editable and opac_display methods
    
    This patch adds two methods to the Koha::Patron::Attribute:
    
    - opac_display
    - opac_editable
    
    Both method just check the corresponding Koha::Patron::Attribute::Type
    and return the values for those attributes. This is useful to avoid
    checking that manually on the controller scripts.

    Bug 17755: Introduce Koha::Object::Limit::Library
    
    This patch introduces a new class for extending Koha::Object using
    multiple inheritance. It cannot be used standalone, it needs to be
    used in Koha::Object implementations like this:
    
    use base qw( Koha::Object Koha::Object::Limit::Library );
    
    Its goal is to provide a single way and place to deal with this common
    pattern in Koha's codebase.
    
    As it happened with Koha::Object, that needed to be tested in a real object
    class, this work was done on top of Koha::Patron::Attribute::Type implementation
    and it is fully covered by the tests that are introduced for it.

    Bug 15854: Use a READ and WRITE LOCK on message_queue
    
    To make sure we will not never get a race conditions for these kinds of
    notices, we need to add a LOCK on the message_queue table.
    
    This does not smell the best way to do that, but I faced deadlock issues
    when I tried to use "UPDATE FOR"
    
    https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-locking-reads.html
    https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/lock-tables.html
    https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/commit.html
    
    To test this patch, or another solution, you need to apply manually this
    change:
    
             my $message = C4::Message->find_last_message($borrower, $type, $mtt);
             unless ( $message ) {
    +            sleep(1);
                 C4::Message->enqueue($letter, $borrower, $mtt);
             } else {
    
    And repeat the test plan from first patch.
    Do not forget to truncate the message_queue table.
    
    Followed test plans, works as expected.

    Bug 15854: Simplify the code to limit race conditions
    
    There is an obvious race condition when CHECKIN and RENEWAL are
    generated from circulation.pl calling svc/renew or svc/checkin in AJAX.
    
    The 2 first queries will try to get the id of the last message
    (find_last_message) and if it does not exist, they will insert it.
    Theorically that could be lead to have several "digest" messages for a
    given patron.
    I did not recreate more than 2 messages, from the third one at least one
    of the two firsts existed in the DB already.
    
    This patch just simplifies the code to make the SELECT and INSERT or
    UPDATE closer and limit the race condition possibilities.
    
    Test plan:
    0. Set RenewalSendNotice and circ rules to have a lot of renewals available
    1. Use batch checkouts (or one by one) to check out several items to a
    patron
    2. Empty message_queue (at least of this patron)
    3. Renew them all at once ("select all" link, "renew or check in"
    button)
    4. Check the message_queue
    Without this patch you have lot of chances to faced a race condition and
    get at least 2 messages for the same patron. This is not expected, we
    expect 1 digest with all the messages.
    With this patch apply you have lot of chances not to face it, but it's
    not 100% safe as we do not use a mechanism to lock the table at the DBMS
    level.
    
    Tested both patches together, works as expected.

    Bug 18010: Remove potential exposure from gettemplate
    
    A similar bad template check from C4::Auth::get_template_and_user
    should be applied in C4::Templates::gettemplate.
    
    Before this patch it would be possible to expose files like:
    my $template = C4::Templates::gettemplate(
        '/etc/passwd', 'intranet', CGI::new, 1
    );
    print $template->output;
    
    Note that the is_plugin flag in the above call is the culprit. This patch
    provides a quick security fix without touching get_template_and_user, and
    can be backported to stable branches.
    I will provide an enhanced and centralized check on report 17989, also
    removing the is_plugin flag.
    
    Note: We allow .pref here too for use in admin/preferences.pl.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Auth.t (triggering get_template_and_user and
        gettemplate).
    [2] Run t/db_dependent/Templates.t again (see first test plan).
        The tests should no longer fail.
    [3] Open a page on opac or intranet.
    [4] Open a systempreferences tab.
    [5] Add a book to the cart and send it ([opac-]sendbasket uses gettemplate).

    Bug 18066: Hea V2
    
    This patch is the Koha part of the Hea v2 project.
    You can find the (testing) code for the server at
      hea-ws  - https://github.com/joubu/hea-ws/commits/v2
      hea-app - https://github.com/joubu/hea-app/commits/v2
    They contain the different pull requests made over the last 6 months.
    
    More information on Hea at https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/KohaUsageStat_RFC
    The goal of this commit message is to provide an overview of what could
    be a new version of Hea.
    
    Prior to these changes, the Hea database was filled with 1 line per Koha
    installation. System preferences were filled by the libraries and a
    cronjob (share_usage_with_koha_community.pl) collected these values to send
    them to a webservice (hea-ws/upload.pl).
    
    With the need to collect more data we would want to collect data at the library
    level (branch) and not at the installation level.
    For instance the geolocation, the url or the country can be different from one
    library to another, even if managed from the same Koha installation.
    The Hea DB has been upgraded to reflect that change (see hea-app/sql/schema.sql).
    
    The hidden goal of this patch is to make Hea sexier and explain
    better to libraries how it can be useful to share their information
    with the Koha community. I guess the main problem is the lack of
    communication and explanations about what we are doing we these data.
    To fill this gap I'd like to (TODO)
      1. Communicate on the ML about this new version of Hea (once it got
    pushed and backported)
      2. Link the Privacy_Policy.md from the Hea interface
      3. Get help from a native English speaker to add
    popup/help/info/whatever on "Home ‚Ä∫ Administration ‚Ä∫ Usage statistics",
    to clearly explain what happens (and what will not happen!) when an option or
    another is set.
    
    You can find screenshot of this whole enhancement on bug 18066, comment 2.
    
    What this patch does:
    - Create a new branches.geolocation DB field
    - Add 3 new sysprefs:
      * UsageStatsGeolocation
      * UsageStatsLibrariesInfo
      * UsageStatsPublicID
    - Integrate the Leaflet JS library to get a fancy map to pick
    geolocations
    
    How does it works:
    On the new administration page where statistics to share are configured,
    there are several new things. It is now possible to share information either
    per Koha installation or libraries. If UsageStatsLibrariesInfo is set,
    the info at library level (url, name, country, geolocation) will be
    sent to the Hea webservice. If it is not set, you can decide to fill
    UsageStatsLibraryUrl, UsageStatsLibraryName, UsageStatsCountry,
    UsageStatsGeolocation to share these information. Note that even if the
    data are retrieved at installation level, it's better to fill the prefs
    as well: On the Hea website the different libraries defined for a given
    Koha installation could be displayed on the same page.
    This page is a public page which will be attributed to every
    installation (with the pref UsageStatsPublicID). On this page all the
    info available publicly will be displayed.
    
    TODO later:
    - Add a button on the administration page to delete the info shared
    publicly. It will be easy to show that the info are no longer displayed
    on the public page.
    - Add an icon per Koha installation to get a better "public page"
    - Any suggestions?
    
    Test plan:
    We will need to test hea-ws, hea-app and the Koha-side code to test the
    whole enhancement.
    1/ To start, clone the hea-ws and hea-app project and checkout the
    'master' branch (*not* 'v2')
    2/ Create the hea database and user
      CREATE DATABASE hea
      CREATE USER 'hea'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'hea';
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON hea.* TO 'hea'@'localhost';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    3/ Fill the DB with some data
      mysql hea < hea-app/sql/schema.sql
      mysql hea < hea-app/sql/sql/mock-data.sql
    4/ Checkout the 'v2' branch for both hea-ws and hea-app
    5/ Execute the upgrade DB script
      % cd hea-app
      % perl -p -i -e 's/REPLACE_ME/hea/' sql/upgrade.pl # Fill the DB info
      % perl sql/upgrade.pl
    Now the DB is using the v2 structure. That means we have 1 installation
    row per library previously defined. 1 library row has also been created.
    5/ Configure hea-ws
    % echo '192.168.50.1 hea.koha-community.org' >> /etc/hosts
    <VirtualHost *:80>
      DocumentRoot "/path/to/hea-ws"
      ServerName "hea.koha-community.org"
      <Directory "/">
        Options +ExecCGI
        Require all granted
        AddHandler cgi-script .pl
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
    
    And enable it with a2ensite, then restart apache.
    The copy the database.yml.sample to database.yml and edit it to fill the
    DB info.
    
    6/ Launch the hea-app
      % cd hea-app
      % edit README.md # to install the missing modules
      % cp environments/config.yml environments/development.yml
      % edit environments/development.yml # to fill the DB info
      % perl bin/app.pl
    Then hit localhost:3000
    You should see a local version of Hea with sample data
    
    7/ Back to Koha side
    A. We will test that the webservice still works with previous version of Koha (without v2)
    a. Do not configure Hea
      % perl misc/cronjobs/share_usage_with_koha_community.pl -f -v
    Then hit localhost:3000
    => Nothing added
    b. Configure Hea on admin/usage_statistics.pl
    perl misc/cronjobs/share_usage_with_koha_community.pl -f -v
    => New library added
    c. Modify the Hea configuration
    perl misc/cronjobs/share_usage_with_koha_community.pl -f -v
    => Info are modified
    
    B. Not we will test that it works with the new version (much more fun ;))
    % git checkout hea-v2 # koha
    a. Configure Hea using /admin/usage_statistics.pl
    perl misc/cronjobs/share_usage_with_koha_community.pl -f -v
    => Check the result on localhost:3000
    b. Share libraries's info
    perl misc/cronjobs/share_usage_with_koha_community.pl -f -v
    c. Continue to play a bit and share the info.

    Added a new syspref to Load history to the next user
    
    Added a syspref LoadHistory addSearchHistoryToTheFirstLoggedUser to select if you want the system to add the history of searches performed without session when you log in as registered user.
    TEST PLAN
    1 - Search in the catalogue, check you are not logged
    2 - Log in : your last history should appear
    4 - Log out
    5 - Apply the patch
    6 - Repeat 1 and 2
    7 - Desactivate the syspref addSearchHistoryToTheFirstLoggedUser
    8 - Repeat 1 and 2 : your last history shouldn't appear
    
    The Unit test doesn't rollback but delete the added lines : the function get_template_and_user allway sets the autocommit to 1.

    Bug 18150 - CanItemBeReserved doesn't work with (IndependentBranches AND ! canreservefromotherbranches)
    
    The variable $item used to be a hash, but at the end of the function,
    it's a Koha object. As $item->{homebranch} doesn't yield anything and
    should be $item->homebranch. It prevents people using different
    branches without holds between branches from placing a hold on an item
    they should be able to place hold on.
    
    Test plan:
    
    1. Before patch
    
      a. with IndependantBranches off
      b. try to place hold on an item you should be able to place hold on
      c. it should work
      d. put IndependantBranches on and canreservefromotherbranches off
      e. shouldn't work
    
    2. after patches redo steps from (1) and everything should be working
    fine.

    Remove use of ECMASCRIPT 2015 default parameter syntax in
    jquery.fixFloat.js to be compatible
    with a wider range of browser versions.
    
    Test plan:
      1. Usa a not so modern browser, for example Chrome/Chromium < 49, any version of IE
      besides Edge, Opera, or Firefox < 15.0.
      2. Edit a bibliographic record in staff client and try switching to
      advanced MARC editor (check console, no errors should appear).

    Bug 18242: [SOLUTION 2]Handle correctly move to old_issues
    
    The table old_issues has a primary key defined on the issue_id column.
    This issue_id comes from the issues table when an item is checked in.
    
    In some case the value of issue_id already exists in the table
    
    Basically this happens when an item is returned and mysqld is restarted:
    The auto increment value for issues.issue_id will be reset to
    MAX(issue_id)+1 (which is the value of the last entry of old_issues).
    See also the description of bug 18003 for more informations.
    
    In this solution the change is done at code level instead of DB
    structure: If old_issues.issue_id already exists before moving from
    the issues table, the issue_id is updated (not on cascade for
    accountlines.issue_id, should it?) before the move.

    Bug 18284: (bug 17196 follow-up) Move biblio metadata when a biblio is deleted
    
    There is a deletedbiblio_metadata table but it is not populated when a
    biblio is deleted. Since we have a ON DELETE constraint on
    biblio_metadata.biblionumber, the row is deleted when the biblio entry
    is deleted => data lost!
    
    Test plan:
    - Create a biblio
    - Delete it
    
    => Without this patch the deletedbiblio_metadata table is not populated
    with the biblio_metadata row related to the biblio
    
    => With this patch applied you should see that the row has been moved.
    
    Followed test plan, behaves as expected

    Bug 18275: Do not rely on CGI param userid to log a user in if auth is not required
    
    From opac/opac-memberentry.pl, authnotrequired is set.
    That means a patron can access the page without being logged in. It is
    used on this page for the self registration feature.
    
    From C4::Auth::get_template_and_user, we have
      $userid = $q_userid;
    $q_userid is previously set to the 'userid' CGI param.
    
    We end up here if authonotrequired is set AND CGISESSID does not exist.

    Charges should not include elements less than a penny/cent
    they are not displayed but can be saved to the database

    Removed the one case where it was rounded post call.
    Although the main danger is values generated by the discount
    calculation apply the rounding to all returned charges in case
    the item charge is defined using the 3rd or 4th decimal
    places.

    Edit 2: Creates the syspref to activate or deactivate the sidebar
    Edit 3: Fixing merge conflicts, using Koha::BiblioFrameworks to find FA
    framework and adding sidebar to on-site checkouts

    2) Go to all of the above pages and confirm the sidebar menu shows up
    3) Confirm fast cataloguing link and transfer link are there
    4) Trigger any error messages you can possibly think of (i.e. on renew.pl: barcode does not exist). Confirm that this does not mess up the layout of the page
    5) Go to a user account page, Check out tab. (Since this is a circ/circulation.pl page). Ensure the circ nav sidebar doesn't show up (confirm it looks as it usually does)
    6) Deactivate circSidebar
    7) Confirm pages all look normal

    Bug 15427 : Enable TLS support for MySQL
    
    In summary, changes are:
    1) If you have chosen MySQL, Makefile.PL will ask you if you want TLS (default:
    "no"), and then the locations for CA cert, client cert and client key
    (reasonable defaults are provided). Settings <tls>, <ca>, <cert> and <key> are
    added in koha-conf.xml
    2) If <tls>yes</tls> in koha-conf.xml, the installer and database connection
    scripts add the TLS options in both DBI connection strings and mysql command
    line
    
    To test
    1/ Apply patch
    2/ Check everything still works and db connections are the same as before
    3/ Either run Makefile.PL and step through the options or edit your koha-conf.xml to
    enable TLS
    4/ Check db connections are still working
    
    Patch provided to me by Dimitris Kamenopoulos and I reformatted it into a git patch,
    any errors are probably mine

    Bug 14764: OPAC news selector
    
    Test plan:
    
    1) Add more than one library, at least two in total is needed. Make note
       of which is your current user's home branch.
    2) Go to Tools -> News and add one global ("All") news item and one
       specific for each branch.
    3) Apply the patches.
    4) Perform database upgrades when you log in.
    5) Go to OPAC main, it should work as before: Showing global news as
       well as the news for your home branch once logged in.
    6) Go to System Preferences -> OPAC and set 'OPACNewsBranchSelect' to
       yes.
    7) Go to OPAC main, you should see the global news item plus any items
       for your home branch for the current user if logged in.
    8) Above the news, you will see a dropdown that lists the branches.
       Select one, and click "Change library."
    9) You should now see global news and the news for the selected branch,
       regardless of whether logged in or not.
    
    Sponsored-By: Halland County Library
    
    Fixes QA comments:
    
    * Keep the current selected branch selected
    
    * Change OPACNewsBranchSelect -> OPACNewsLibrarySelect
    
    * fix 'system wide only' view for logged in user. We still show system
      wide even when a library is selected.
    
    * Removed the "change library" link
    
    * Added a label to the field.

    Bug 10978: Redirect to basket list of a supplier after deleting a basket
    
    This patch redirects to the vendor's list of baskets after deleting a
    basket, fixes breadcrumbs after deletion and also hides the toolbar
    actions after deletion (seeing as you can't edit/export etc a basket
    that no longer exists).
    
    To test:
    1) Go to Acquisitions -> find a vendor -> view a basket or create a new
    basket
    2) Delete the basket. Notice you are taken to a list of all vendors and
    baskets
    3) Apply patch and do step 1 again
    4) Delete the basket. Notice appropriate breadcrumbs, no toolbar, and
    confirm link to return to baskets for the vendor works.
    
    Sponsored-by: Catalyst IT
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected (links to vendor's baskets and all baskets)

    This patch changes the barcode input on add list to a textarea and
    process multiples barcodes to allow for adding many items to a list
    at once
    
    To test:
     1 - Create a list
     2 - Add some items
     3 - Verify items are added and success reported
     4 - Add these items again
     5 - Verify you are notified they were not added
     6 - Type invalid barcodes into the text area and submit
     7 - Verify you are notifed of failure to add
     8 - Try going to a list that doesn't exist and adding barcodes
      i.e. http://localhost:8081/cgi-bin/koha/virtualshelves/shelves.pl?op=add_biblio&shelfnumber=9999&barcodes=4
     9 - Verify correct error
    10 - Try the above but with a list that exists while signed in as a patron
         without lists permission:
         i.e. http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/koha/opac-shelves.pl?op=view&shelfnumber=3

    Bug 18169: Make 'before' param non mandatory for Koha::Patrons->anonymise_issue_history
    
    From opac-privacy.pl:
    
        # delete all reading records for items returned
        # uses a hardcoded date ridiculously far in the future
    
        my $rows = eval {
            Koha::Patrons->search({ 'me.borrowernumber' => $borrowernumber })->anonymise_issue_history( { before => '2999-12-12' } );
        };
    
    It sounds better to make this before parameter not mandatory, and remove the condition from the sql query if it is not passed.
    
    Test plan:
    1. Anonymise your reading history at the OPAC.
    2. Confirm that all your reading history has been anonymised

    Bug 18070: [Follow-up] What should DelAuthority return?
    
    Script tools/batch_delete_records.pl only checks the return value of
    DelAuthority. The return value depends on DBI rows, which is not always
    reliable. It may return -1 when it 'does not know'.
    
    Testing $@ in tools/batch_delete_records.pl should actually be enough.
    The return value was discarded in C4/ImportBatch.pm. Removing an unused
    variable.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Pick an authority record with a few linked biblios.
        Delete this authority record via tools/batch_delete_records.pl.
        Check if the linked biblio records are cleaned up.
    [2] Bonus: Make a typo in the SQL statement of DelAuthority. Check
        if batch_delete_records shows you the error message.

    Bug 18070: Extend sub merge to remove fields for deleted authorities
    
    In order to accomplish this, we need to add some additional checks in
    the merge routine. The actual change to remove the field, is quite
    small.
    
    Furthermore, we need to add a merge call in DelAuthority and adjust
    the merge cron job accordingly.
    
    The change is well supported by additional tests, including a simulation
    of postponed removal via cron, if dontmerge is enabled.
    
    Note: Deleting an authority with linked biblios is tested on the next
    patch.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Authorities/Merge.t
    [2] Delete an authority without linked biblios from the Authorities
        module. If the indexer is not fast enough, wait a bit and refresh to
        verify that the authority is gone on authorities-home.pl.

        patron category, branch, and cardnumber but no timestamp.
    
    6. Apply this patch
    
    7. Repeat steps 1,2, 3, 4
    
    8. You will now see timestamp in the format "Requested: YYYY-MM-DD
    HH:MM:SS" next to each patrons details near the top of each pending
    request box.

    Bug 16966: Koha::Patrons - Move GetBorrowersWithIssuesHistoryOlderThan to search_patrons_to_anonymise
    
    The C4::Members::GetBorrowersWithIssuesHistoryOlderThan subroutine is supposed
    to return the patrons with an issue history older than a given date.
    
    It would make more sense to return a list of Koha::Patrons.
    
    On the way, the code from AnonymiseIssueHistory will be moved as well to
    anonymise_issue_history.
    
    Note that these 2 subroutines are strongly linked: one is used to know the
    number of patrons we will anonymise the history, the other one is used to
    anonymise the issues history. The problem is that the first one is not used to
    do the action, but only for displayed purpose.
    
    In some cases, these 2 values can differ, which could be confusing.
    Case 1:
    The logged in librarian is not superlibrarian and IndependentBranches is set:
    if 2+ patrons from different libraries match the date parameter, the interface
    will display "Checkout history for 2 patrons will be anonymized", when actually
    only 1 will be.
    Case 2:
    If 2+ patrons match the date parameter but one of them has his privacy set to
    forever (privacy=0), the same issue will appear.
    
    This patch moves the code from C4::Members::GetBorrowersWithIssuesHistoryOlderThan
    to Koha::Patrons->search_patrons_to_anonymise and from
    C4::Circulation::AnonymiseIssueHistory to
    Koha::Patrons->anonymise_issue_history
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Confirm the 2 issues and make sure they are fixed using the Batch
    patron anonymization tool (tools/cleanborrowers.pl)
    2/ At the OPAC, use the 'Immediate deletion' button to delete all your
    reading history (regardless the setting of the privacy rule)
    3/ Use the cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/batch_anonymise.pl) to
    anonymise patrons.

    This patch move the history anonymisation code to the Patrons.t test
    file and the entire subtest related to StoreLastBorrower to
    StoreLastBorrower.t
    
    It just moves and add some minor adjustements.

    Bug 17992: REST api: Remove the use of ->unblessed from Cities controller
    
    As bug 17932 adds TO_JSON to Koha::Object(s), there's no need for using
    it. Also, as this is a reference implementation for developers to copy
    and paste it is sensible to make this change even when this is not
    causing any bug.
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patch
    - Run:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev
     k$ cd kohaclone

    this require more tests for the case where 2+ items are reserved.
    
    I tried to add 1 more reserve to the main test suit, but too many other tests
    rely on specific holds, and I couldn't get around it.
    
    Instead, I added a subtest that consider the specific simple case and leave the
    other test cases exactly has they were designed.

    Bug 17260: updatedatabase.pl fails on invalid entries in ENUM and BOOLEAN columns
    
    The loading of file admin/searchengine/elasticsearch/mappings.yaml
    specifies 'type' as empty, which fails with Mysql 5.7+ which is more
    stringent.
    
    Also, forcing an empty value into a boolean also fails.
    
    Both issues arise when updatedatabase.pl hit 3.23.00.050.
    
    NOTE: both issues could also be resolved by actually setting values in
          the load file. This doesn't make this solution incorrect, though.
    
    To Test/reproduce:
    -1) Happens with Mysql 5.7.4.  Maybe earlier, but certainly at
        that point. Use a Xenial kohadevbox to more easily test.
    0) Find a database on 3.22 or earlier, save it.
        a) place
               sql_mode=IGNORE_SPACE,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
           into the [mysqld] section of /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
        b) restart you mysql server
        c) drop the db and recreate it
        d) checkout the 3.22.x branch
        e) do a web install
        f) remove the added sql_mode
        g) restart the mysql server
    1) Set your code base to master
    2) run updatedatabase.pl
    3) See the errors on 3.23.00.050
    4) Apply the patch
    5) Reload the 3.22 db.
       a) repeat steps 0(a)-0(g)
       b) don't forget the caching issues
    6) succeed with updatedatabase.pl
    7) drop the db and recreate it
    8) run the web installer
    9) notice no issues either.
    10) run koha qa test tools
    
    NOTE: This bug only solved the upgrade portion.
          I added the kohastructure.sql change as well.
          I confirmed that all the code changes were
          triggered with this test plan.

    Bug 12461 - Add patron clubs feature
    
    This features would add the ability to create clubs which patrons may be
    enrolled in. It would be particularly useful for tracking summer reading
    programs, book clubs and other such clubs.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Run updatedatabase.pl
    3) Ensure your staff user has the new 'Patron clubs' permissions
    4) Under the tools menu, click the "Patron clubs" link
    5) Create a new club template
       * Here you can add fields that can be filled out at the time
         a new club is created based on the template, or a new enrollment
         is created for a given club based on the template.
    6) Create a new club based on that template
    7) Attempt to enroll a patron in that club
    8) Create a club with email required set
    9) Attempt to enroll a patron without an email address in that club
    10) Create a club that is enrollable from the OPAC
    11) Attempt to enroll a patron in that club
    12) Attempt to cancel a club enrollment from the OPAC
    13) Attempt to cancel a club enrollment from the staff interface
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 18026: Correct URL to database columns from .pref files
    
    Recently the DB schema website has been updated.
    The link to the columns' tables is now

      http://schema.koha-community.org/16_11/tables/table.html

    instead of
      http://schema.koha-community.org/tables/table.html
    
    To have a specific schema per Koha version.
    
    To avoid fixing this link every release this patch adds a __VERSION__
    marker to replace with the $version if stable ($version % 2) or 'master'
    
    Test plan:

    Bug 18111: Swap framework_name and frameworkcode
    
    With the frameworkcode changed to an empty string, which really
    is closer to the physical reality, some javascript somewhere
    breaks. This means the spinner does not appear when you confirm
    that you wish to import it.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ----------
    1) apply first patch
    2) export default framework, doesn't matter format
    3) import default framework using that file.
    4) answer yes or whatever it is.
       -- spinner does not appear.
    5) apply this patch
    6) import default framework use the same file.
    7) answer yes or whatever it is.
       -- spinner does appear.
    8) decide if you wish to find and fix the javascript conditions.
       if yes -- do so, and then obsolete this once you have.
       if not -- sign this off after running koha qa test tools

    Bug 17453: Inter-site holds improvement
    
    At the moment users can reserve items and choose any library as a pick up
    location, but there is no mechanism to prevent users from reserving items that
    are available on the shelf at any given location from reserving the item at the
    same location, essentially creating a Fetch and Collect scenario.
    This has an impact on staff workloads as they are having to process reservations
    and check shelves for items that students can already come and collect from the
    open library shelves.
    The aim of this enhancement is to decrease the impact on staff workload there
    should be a restriction in place that prevents users from requesting items for
    collection at a library where the item is currently available.
    
    Implementation:
    We first tried to add a new circulation rule adding a 4th
    ‚ÄúNotIfAvailableAtPickupLibrary‚Äù option to "On shelf holds allowed".
    That would make the development more flexible.
    But in that case we quickly faced non-trivial problematics:
    Let's say you have 3 items I1, I2 and I3. The first one has onshelfholds
    set to Yes and 2 others has it set to ‚ÄúNotIfAvailableAtPickupLibrary‚Äù.
    What would be the expected behavior if a hold is placed at biblio level?
    And if a hold is placed at item level for I1?
    This second point could be answered by reworking the interface to move
    the libraries dropdown list elsewhere (1 list per item) or by adding a
    lot of JS code to handle the different situation. But it would be
    much more complicated to implement.
    So finally I moved back to the simple approach and added a new pref to
    handle the behavior globally.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Switch off OPACHoldsIfAvailableAtPickup
    1/ Let's say you have 3 libraries L1, L2, L3, create 2 items owned by L1
    and L2
    2/ Place a biblio level hold. You should only be able to pick it up at
    L3
    2/ Place a item level hold. You should only be able to pick it up at
    L3
    3/ Create a third items owned by L3
    4/ Now you should not be able to place a hold on this record anymore

    Bug 7626: Delete multiple tags in OPAC at once
    
    This patch removes the individual 'Delete' buttons for every tag as
    suggested in Comment 0. It adds a checkbox to every tag, with a 'Delete
    selected tags' button at the bottom of the table. This patch also adds a
    function to check if any checkboxes have been checked before submitting
    the form (only works with JS enabled).
    
    To test:
    1) Find a record in the OPAC and add some tags to it
    2) Go to your tags and notice the checkboxes, no more delete buttons for
    each tag
    3) Click 'Delete selected tags' button without selecting any tags
    4) Confirm alert shows up. Click OK
    5) Select one or more tags and click 'Delete selected tags' button
    6) Confirm delete is successful and correct number of deleted tags shows
    up

    Bug 17932: (followup) Fix /patrons endpoint
    
    Bug 17927 introduced data type fixes on the /patrons endpoint (integer
    and boolean types got fixed). This led to the /patrons endpoint not to
    work because the underlying code didn't provide the right data.
    
    With the introduction of TO_JSON on Koha::Object(s) we now have a way to
    output the proper data types.
    
    This patch does so by:
    - Adding is_boolean => 1 to the relevant columns on the Borrower.pm
      schema file.
    - Tweaking the controller class for the /patrons endpoint so it doesn't
      use the $object(s)->unblessed call but just let the Mojo::JSON library
      pick out TO_JSON implementation instead on rendering the output.
    - It adds a new test for booleans.
    
    To test:
    - Have 17927 applied
    - Run:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/api/v1/patrons.t
    => FAIL: Tests fail [1]
    - Apply this patches

      $ prove t/db_dependent/api/v1/patrons.t

    Bug 17932: Add a TO_JSON method to Koha::Object(s)
    
    Bug 17927 fixes data types on the current REST endpoints. If you
    test those endpoints, you will notice trying to access them (for listing
    or retrieving single objects yields a data type error. Notably on
    booleans but also on integers.
    
    Integers fail due to https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=119904
    but it needs some global solution until there's a DBD::mysql release
    backported to the supported distros. There's the option to use
    http://search.cpan.org/~frew/DBIx-Class-Helpers-2.033002/lib/DBIx/Class/Helper/Row/NumifyGet.pm
    to get the integer columns fixed as a workaround:
    
     __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
        borrowernumber => {
            data_type         => 'integer',
            is_nullable       => 0,
            is_numeric        => 1,
        }
    );
    
    I didn't find bug reports related to this (maybe because we don't use
    warnings everywhere) But I don't think is worth going such a heavy
    overhead.
    
    A similar situation takes place for Boolean values. They need to be
    prepared for JSON output. This could have been done using DBIx filters
    as pointed out by Martin:
    
    __PACKAGE__->filter_column(
        lost => {
           filter_to_storage => sub { $_[1] ? 1 : 0 },
           filter_from_storage =>
                   sub { $_[1] ? Mojo::JSON->true :
                                 Mojo::JSON->false }
           }
    );
    
    but this could have other consequences that are worth exploring on
    another bug (i.e. it would mean we need to take care of every place
    where this boolean data is used/set needs to handle this data types
    nicely. Such would be the case if we were a Mojo-only app, but we
    aren't. We use Koha::Obect(s) in the whole app. Period.
    
    This patch adds the need to specify on the schema files, columns that
    are actually boolean, because we have no way to detect them for now
    (i.e. they are all tinyint, but we use tinyint for non-boolean stuff
     too).
    So if this patch is accepted, we would need to specify boolean columns
    like this:
    
    __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
        '+lost' => {
            is_boolean => 1
        }
    );
    
    This patch adds a TO_JSON method for Koha::Object(s) to be used for
    serializing Koha::Object-derived objects into JSON strings.
    
    To test it (as Koha::Object(s) need to be instantiated) I provide tests
    on top of the Koha::Patron(s) classes in the followup patches.
    
    [1] Yes, we use TINYINT(1) for booleans, but from DBIC's perspective
    there's no way to read the (1) in runtime.

    Bug 16018: Merge.pl code cleanup
    
    Original patch from Remi Mayrand-Provencher.
    Amended by Marcel de Rooy (January 2017), part of omnibus bug 17908.
    
    EDIT:
    We cannot remove the ModAuthority call, since the reference record is
    the result of the merge and should be saved.
    Variable $overwrite is not used and can be removed.
    
    It is not useful to postpone a merge to the cron job here, since the
    old authority record is deleted. (Note that bug 9988 will address this
    subject too.)
    
    Removing the call to C4::ImportBatch::SetImportRecordStatus: Since
    $recordid2 is not an import_record_id, this is useless and potentially wrong.
    Removed the if statement for @errors, since it is not used at this point;
    putting the result of a comparison into $error is not useful either.
    
    Note: there is a lot of code in merge.pl around breeding that is actually
    unused. Template tools/manage-marc-import.tt contains two unused blocks
    final_match_link and match_link that contain a (unreachable) call to
    authorities/merge.pl with parameters:
    mergereference=breeding&authid=[% record_lis.match_id %]&authid=[% record_lis.import_record_id %]
    It seems that this would show the records correctly, but would not merge
    them correctly since that code expects two authority records.
    
    Leaving the signoff of Mehdi since he essentially tested the merge call.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Restart Plack and restart koha-indexer. (I had some problems related to
        indexing as a result of the marcxml transition.)
    [2] Go to Authorities.
        Select two authorities to merge, start with two of the same type.
        Make sure that both are used in a few biblio records.
        Select at least one subfield from the authority to be removed for
        inclusion in the authority to be kept ("reference record").
    [3] Click Merge. You come back to the kept authority record.
        Note: The number of attached records may not yet be updated. This depends
        on the speed of koha-indexer. If you wait a bit and refresh, you should
        have the correct number.
        First check the authority record again for the inserted subfield.
        Now check a biblio that was ALREADY attached to the reference record.
        And check a biblio that was FORMERLY attached to the deleted one.
        Note: See bug 17913 to see how pref AuthorityMergeMode impacts this.
    [4] Try steps 2 and 3 again for a merge of two authority records that do not
        have the same authority type noting the remarks below.
        For instance try to merge from a CORPO_NAME to a PERSO_NAME record.
        Make a change in say 040$a of the record to be deleted. And select that
        field later on the merge form.
        Normally, you would use the PERSO_NAME framework in the merge now.
        When checking the authority record, look at 040a. When checking the
        record that was linked to the CORPO_NAME, check if it contains the
        PERSO_NAME authority in the correct field (say 100, 600, 700).

    Bug 16749: Go with a boolean flag, we love booleans
    
    As requested by Jonathan on comment 10 on Bugzilla and supported by Tomas,
    we should use the dev_install entry in koha-conf as a boolean flag.
    Since we already used it as a path, this patch is not too strict about it.
    If the entry is not empty and not equal to "0", we will interpret it as
    a true value. The path is taken from the intranetdir entry.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Copy debian/scripts/koha-functions.sh to /usr/share/koha/bin
    [2] For a dev install:
        Remove the dev install line, or toggle its value between empty string,
        0 or 1 and each time test stop/start koha-indexer.
        Check the path to rebuild_zebra with ps aux|grep indexer.
        If you have no entry, an empty entry or a zero, you should see a regular
        path.
        (Note: You can do something similar with koha-start-sip.)
    [3] For a regular install:
        Remove the dev install line.
        Stop/start koha-indexer or koha-plack, and verify that it still works.
        Add a dev_install line with 0, and repeat stop/start.

    Bug 16749: Adjustments for koha-translate
    
    [AMENDED February 10, 2017]
    
    [1] Added reading /etc/default/koha-common as in the other debian scripts.
        We need it for KOHA_HOME.
    [2] Add a -d|--dev parameter for dev installs.
    [3] No hardcoded PERL5LIB or KOHA_INSTALL_DIR (KOHA_HOME).
        They are read from default file or set by adjust_paths_dev_install.
    [4] Adjust template paths for dev installs: OPAC_TMPL, INTRANET_TMPL.
    [5] Remove references to obsolete themes ccsr and prog.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Regular package install:
        Copy koha-translate to /usr/sbin.
        Run koha-translate -l to show installed languages.
        Run koha-translate -l -a to show available languages.
        Add a language: koha-translate -i nl-NL.
        Check template folders in regular location (/usr/share/koha/...)
        Remove a language: koha-translate -r nl-NL. Check again.
    [2] Dev install or kohadevbox:
        Copy koha-translate to /usr/sbin.
        If needed, add the <dev_install> line to koha-conf.xml.
        Run koha-translate -l -d yourinstance to show installed languages.
        (Note: You only see the languages installed in this instance.)
        Add a language: koha-translate -i nl-NL -d yourinstance.
        Check template folders in the clone.
        Remove a language: koha-translate -r nl-NL -d yourinstance.
    
        Note: Make sure you have sufficient file permissions for the kohaclone
        files and koha-conf.xml. On kohadevbox you might need to run sudo
        koha-translate within the the vagrant user context.

    Bug 16749: Adjustments for koha-plack
    
    [1] Use run_safe_xmlstarlet for plack workers and requests
    [2] Simplify adjust_paths. The lazy export statement is actually enough to
        replace adjust_paths by one direct call to adjust_paths_dev_install.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Copy koha-functions.sh and koha-plack:
        cp [YOUR_PATH]/debian/scripts/koha-functions.sh /usr/share/koha/bin/
        cp [YOUR_PATH]/debian/scripts/koha-plack /usr/sbin/
        where YOUR_PATH might well be /home/vagrant/kohaclone.
    [2] Make sure that you have dev_install in koha-conf.
        Stop and start koha-plack. Verify with ps aux|grep plack.
    [3] Rename dev_install to nodev_install (in start and end tag).
        Now stop/start koha-plack. Verify with ps aux|grep plack.
    [4] Change plack_requests to 51 in your koha-conf.
        Restart Plack and check that you see 51 in ps aux|grep plack.

    Bug 16749: Adjust xmlstarlet calls in koha-functions
    
    In various scripts we use xmlstarlet to extract values from koha-conf.
    If we call xmlstarlet on non-existing entries in koha-conf, this may
    however result in silently failing scripts (when set -e is in effect).
    
    A function run_safe_xmlstarlet is added for situations where the entry
    might not exist. It will not halt execution.
    
    This patch only adjusts koha-functions.sh and modifies the xmlstarlet calls
    for dev_install and zebra_loglevels.
    
    Note: The function does not need to check file existence. If the file does
    not exist, xmlstarlet warns about it; the function returns empty string,
    but does not set an error exit status.
    
    Test plan: See second patch ("koha-plack adjustments").

    Bug 17972 - Reformat acquisitions sidebar menu with acquisitions and administration sections
    
    This patch makes changes to acquisitions-menu.inc so that the style
    matches that of the Administration and Tools sidebar menus. The links
    are now divided up between Acquisitions (/acqui/) and Administration
    (/admin/). The link-highlighting JavaScript used elsewhere has been
    added.
    
    To test, apply the patch and view the Acquisitions home page.
    
    - Check that the "Acquisitions home" link is highlighted (bold).
    - Test the other Acquisitions links to confirm that highlighting works.
    - Click any link in the Administration section of the sidebar menu.
    - Confirm that everything looks correct and works correctly.

    Bug 17962: TT syntax for notices - Prove that ACQ_NOTIF_ON_RECEIV is compatible
    
    To make ACQ_NOTIF_ON_RECEIV TT compatible, we need to expose data from
    the aqorders table. We already have a package for it in the Koha
    namespace but it is based on Koha::Object[s].
    The other path creates dummy Koha::Tmp::Order[s] packages to make it
    usable. Of course we should use a valid Koha::Acquisition::Order[s]
    based on Koha::Object, but it's outside the scope of this bug report.
    
    This notice template is quite simple, and it's a good one to start.
    From C4::Acq::NotifyOrderUsers, GetPreparedLetter is called with 4
    elements: the library, the patron to notify, the biblio and the order
    information.
    Note that prior to this patch aqorders was filled from GetOrder, which
    retrieved a lot of information from the acquisition table (aqbasket,
    aqbookseller). The idea with the TT syntax is to access the data from
    where it really exists. So if a user wants to display the basket name,
    [% order.basket.basketname %] should be used instead.
    Note that this will not work at the moment, the basket method is not
    defined in the order package.
    
    However the basic template should work as before.
    The test added to TemplateToolkit proves that.
    
    Test plan:
    Use the default ACQ_NOTIF_ON_RECEIV to notify a patron that an order has
    been received.
    That generated template should be exactly the same as prior to this
    patch.

    Bug 17950: Improve quick UNIMARC fix in Merge.t
    
    Bug 17909 and 17913 added a quick fix for Merge.t on UNIMARC records.
    This patch improves that fix with the sub compare_fields, a merge from
    compare_field_count and compare_field_order.
    Also it adds the option to test MARC21/UNIMARC by adding a command line
    switch that triggers mocking the marcflavour preference.
    The test on a cleared field 609 in strict mode has been broken up in two
    tests: first a count without 609 and then counting 609s only.
    
    Note: Could have mocked GetMarcBiblio too, but decided to go this way.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run perl t/db_dependent/Authorities/Merge.t
    [2] (For UNIMARC users:) Run perl Merge.t -flavour MARC21
    [3] (For others:) Run perl Merge.t -flavour UNIMARC

    Bug 18068: ES - Fix location and (home|holding)branch facets
    
    This patch makes the 'Locations' facet work as expected (i.e. having the
    same behaviour it has for Zebra: picking the 952$c in MARC21 and 995e
    for UNIMARC).
    
    It also adds the code to handle holding and home library settings for
    facets and makes the facets show the library name instead of the branch
    code.
    
    The mappings are updated so the labels match what facets.inc expect to
    work properly.
    
    To test:
    - On master, do a search that returns biblios with items having
    homebranch set.
    => FAIL: Under the 'Locations' label on the facets you will notice
    branchcodes are shown.
    - Apply the patch
    - Restart memcached and plack (just in case, it was tricky)
    - Reset your mappings:
      http://localhost:8081/cgi-bin/koha/admin/searchengine/elasticsearch/mappings.pl?op=reset&i_know_what_i_am_doing=1
    - Restart memcached and plack (again, not sure if needed)
    - Make sure this mappings are set:
      homebranch => HomeLibrary
      holdingbranch => HoldingLibrary
      (Note: it might not be set due to the place the yaml file is being picked)
    - Reindex your records:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev
     k$ cd kohaclone
     k$ perl misc/search_tools/rebuild_elastic_search.pl -d -v
    - Repeat the initial search
    => SUCCESS: 'Location' contains the right stuff, 'Home libraries' and
    'Holding libraries' too.

    Bug 18045: Fix Reserves.t tests - caching issues
    
    If the cache has to be cleaned when marc structure is updated.
    
    Before this patch, if the age restriction was not mapped, Reserves.t
    failed with:
      Tag "" is not a valid tag. at t/db_dependent/Reserves.t line 523.
    
    Test plan:
    Just confirm that the tests still pass and that the changes make sense.

    Bug 18136: Fix ExportRemoveFields pre-fill behaviour
    
    Looks like it's caused by bug 13190.
    Variable export_remove_fields is not sent to the template, let's
    retrieve the syspref's value using the TT plugin.
    
    Test plan:
    Fill ExportRemoveFields with something (100a for instance)
    Go on a checkout list page
    At the bottom, the "do not export fields" input box should be pre-filled
    with the content of the syspref

    Bug 18025 - Expired password recovery links cause sql crash
    
    When a user gets an email, but doesn't act or visit it within two days,
         attempting to create a new one causes a collision. We should just
         delete the old one, assuming they still want to reset their
         password.
    
    To test:
    create yourself a borrower with a userid and password.
    Attempt a password recovery on the OPAC
    update the entry in the database for that user to have an expired token
    e.g. update borrower_password_recovery set valid_until = '2017-01-25
    03:25:26' where borrowernumber = 12;
    Attempt another password recovery operation - should error
    apply the patch
    Try it again - no error, new token is generated and additional email
    with new link is sent.
    
    Issue reproduced - is resolved by patch

    Bug 17933 - Internal software error when searching patron without birth date
    
    When patrons don't have date of birth (which is not required) patron
    search results on moremember page produce internal server error since we
    can't convert MySQL invalid date 0000-00-00 to datetime object and
    call strfdate on it.
    
    Additionally, since we assign dates to template variables and after
    than assign whole $data hash to template, later assigment overrides
    previous one, so we see birth date field even for patrons which don't
    have one.
    
    This patch fixes both of those problems.
    
    Test:
    1. edit patron and remove it's birth date
    2. try to search for it, and verify server error
    3. apply patch
    4. repeat search for patron and verify that it works and doesn't
       have enpty birth date field

    [5] Correct a copied POD line from reports/issues_stats.pl in
        reports/reserve_stats.pl.
    [6] Correct a test description in t/db_dependent/Koha/Authorities.t.
        You should never delete the library :)

    Bug 17982: Fix the use of uniq in sub themelanguage
    
    Doing uniq( \@themes ) is useless. It will just return to you the only
    reference you gave it.
    List::MoreUtils::uniq requires a list instead of an arrayref.
    So it is a trivial fix that makes sub themelanguage return one theme instead
    of three themes like [ 'prog', 'prog',  'prog' ].
    Note that Template->new inserts one or two include paths to TT for each of
    these three identical themes.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Templates.t (should no longer fail)
    [2] Run t/db_dependent/Auth.t (triggering themelanguage)
    [3] Open a page on OPAC or intranet. (Did you restart Plack?)

    Bug 18089 - All XSLT testing singleBranchMode = 0 fails to show even if install has only 1 branch
    
    Due to the way it has been implemented, singleBranchMode is set to an
    empty string rather than 0 if there is only one branch. This causes any
    block that tests for singleBranchMOde to be 0 to never appear.

    2) prove t/XSLT.t

    Bug 18014: AddAuthority should respect AUTO_INCREMENT
    
    Instead of using the MAX(authid)+1 logic, AddAuthority should just save
    the record and get the new id. The authid column is an autoincrement.
    
    This eliminates problems where a newly assigned authid also refers to a
    previously deleted record. (And it will not cause problems when refining
    the dontmerge functionality on report 9988.)
    
    Note: ModAuthority also calls AddAuthority to update an existing record; in
    that case we should not create a new record even if the record should not
    be found any more (which should be exceptional).
    
    This patch also simplifies handling of 001 in the authority record: in all
    cases this field is updated now; no need to check its contents.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/AuthoritiesMarc.t
    [2] Add a new authority record via the interface

    Bug 4126 - Exit bulkmarcimport if -a and -b given
    
    Currently it is possible to spceify both --biblios and --authorities
    as command line switches to bulkmarcimport.pl. This does not make sense
    so we should exit early and explain that these switches are mutually
    exclusive.
    
    To test:
    - Run one of these and check that there is no complaint about missing
      options:
      perl misc/migration_tools/bulkmarcimport.pl -a -b
      sudo koha-shell -c "perl misc/migration_tools/bulkmarcimport.pl -a -b"
      kohadev
    - Observe that this displays the perldoc, but does not complain about
      mutually exclusive switches.
    - Apply the patch
    - Rerun the command(s) from earlier.
    - Verify that the script is now halted and a small explanation given.

    Bug 17512: Improve handling dates in C4::Items
    
    This is a follow-up on the internal server error on 0000-00-00 in the items
    column onloan. This patch deals with preventing to have such dates at all
    in the date fields of items.
    
    It is accomplished by:
    [1] Adding a (private) subroutine _mod_item_dates. It takes an item hash
        and replaces date values if needed.
    [2] AddItem and ModItem call _koha_new_item resp. koha_modify_item. In these
        routines a call to the new _mod_item_dates is inserted.
    [3] Although the routine is actually private, I have added some unit tests
        to Items.t.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Add a new item. Fill a correct date in dateaccessioned and an invalid
        date in Price effective from (=replacementpricedate).
    [2] Verify that dateaccessioned is saved correctly and replacementpricedate
        is still null (does not contain 0000-00-00).
    [3] Edit the item again. Fill some text in dateaccessioned and put a correct
        date in replacementpricedate. Verify the results.
    [4] Run t/db_dependent/Items.t

    Bug 17988 - Select2 prevents correct tag expand/minimize functionality
    
    Overview:
    Select2 (Bug 13501) introduced divs and inputs that broke some assumptions about the expected HTML structure.
    Because of that, expanding fields to show all hidden subfields does not work properly.
    
    Steps to Reproduce:
    1. Open some book in the editor or create new (cataloguing/addbiblio.pl)
    2. Try to minimize or expand fields, that have among subfields the following:
            ‚Äî Thesaurus driven subfield ‚Üí subfield with Select2
            ‚Äî Hidden subfield.
    
    Actual Results:
    ¬†‚Äî some fields become hidden, some not, and vice versa
    ¬†‚Äî in the console, you'll see ¬´Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'match' of null¬ª
    
    Expected Results:
    ¬†‚Äî all subfields should minimize/maximize completely
    
    Additional Information:
    This happens because Select2 adds some divs, that do not have ID property.
    The following patch adds check for the needed attribute existance.

    exception will be thrown, reporting the error:
    
    WHILE loop terminated (> 1000 iterations)
    
    The $Template::Directive::WHILE_MAX variable controls this behaviour and can be set
    to a higher value if necessary.
    """
    
    I do not think we want to increase this value, and I do not think we want to display a
    dropdown list with 1000 entries.
    
    This patch replaces the dropdown list with an input text.
    
    Test plan:
    - Set circulation conditions - holds per record = 999
    - Search for record with items
    - Go to the holds tab
    - Search for a patron
    - Verify that when you send your search, the 'internal server error' is not shown
    and you see the input text.
    You should be able to enter a value > than 999 and < 1

    Bug 16115: Remove JS error on item search if NOT_LOAN values do not exist
    
    If NOT_LOAN is not present, the item search form will raise a JS error:
    SyntaxError: expected expression, got '}'
    
    This patch fixes it by handling this specific case.
    
    Note that the "Status" column is still displayed.
    
    Test plan:
    Remove your NOT_LOAN authorised values
    Go on the item search form
    => You will not get the JS error and the "Status" bloc is no longer
    displayed. There is no need to display it if empty.

    Bug 16387: Fix default shortened loan period time
    
    When a loan period is shortened due to using decreaseLoanHighHolds* the time is
    always set to the current time in X days, even if the original loan period is
    given in days and not in hours.
    
    It should default to 23:59 as is normal for loan periods given in days.
    
    As original due date time defaults to 23:59 when given in days, this patch
    modifies the hours and minutes of shortened due date to be equal to original due
    date.

    Bug 15030 - Certain values in serials' items are lost on next edit
    
    When editing serials subscription, we can edit them but some values are not pulled from the DB correctly to be put in the edit box.  If not noticed, the value will be overwritten on the next save.
    
    Test:
    - Create a subscription
    - Edit itemcallnumber (952o?) and make sure to have a different value than the default one.
    - Save.
    - Edit it again
    - The saved value is not there.
    
    This is true for itemcallnumber and a few other fields.
    
    This was caused by calls to ->field($subfield).  This would always fail, of course.

    A taster in Buug 17851
    
    ZE TEST PLAN
    
    0. Remove existing ES and reinstall ES 5.1
       apt-get purge elasticsearch
       Follow instruction here:
       https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html
    
    1. Reset Elasticsearch index since facets are hard coded to dynamic search_marc_mappings.
    1a. perl -e 'use Koha::SearchEngine::Elasticsearch; Koha::SearchEngine::Elasticsearch->reset_elasticsearch_mappings();'
    1b. If you get trouble, simply DELETE FROM [search_fields|search_marc_to_fields|search_marc_mapping];
        and retry 1a.
    1c. Destroy elasticsearch index
        curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/koha_biblios
        so it can be recreated
    
    2. Recreate the index:
       perl misc/search_tools/rebuild_elastic_search.pl
    2a. Add something to index if your koha.biblio-table is empty
    
    3. Fetch all indexed records and the facet for subject__facet
    
    curl -XGET localhost:9200/koha_biblios/data/_search?pretty -d '{
      "aggregations": {
        "my_agg": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "subject__facet"
          }
        }
      }
    }'
    
    4. Run the included tests:
       perl t/db_dependent/Koha_Elasticsearch_Indexer.t
       perl t/db_dependent/Koha_Elasticsearch.t
       perl t/db_dependent/Koha_SearchEngine_Elasticsearch_Search.t
    
    Have fun with your new ES 5.1 cluster!

    Bug 17960: Rename opac_news.new with opac_news.content
    
    The field opac_news.new is very confusing and should be renamed.
    If you want to access it via Koha::NewsItem you will have trouble:
    
      use Koha::News;
      my $news_item = Koha::News->next;
      say $news_item->new;
    
    => Attempt to bless into a reference at /home/vagrant/kohaclone/Koha/Object.pm line 78.
    
    This patchset is going to rename this DB field to opac_news_content instead.
    
    Since the opac_news.new can be used in notice templates, we need to warn the
    user during the update DB process that some templates must be updated.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Apply the first patch "Add a test to highlight the issue" and confirm that
    the test fail
    1/ Apply this second patch
    2/ Execute the DB entry
    3/ Confirm that you get a warning if at least one of your notice templates is
    using opac_news.new
    4/ Confirm that the test new pass
    5/ Add/update and delete a news
    6/ Confirm that the RSS new feed still works as expected

    Bug 17610 - Allow the number of plack workers and max connections to be set in koha-conf.xml
    
    It would be nice if we could control the number of workers and max
    requests on a per instance basis, rather than the numbers being
    hardcoded in the plack startup script.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Build a new package of Koha with this patch applied ; )
    2) Verify koha-plack still works
    3) Add the following to the config section of your koha-conf.xml:
     <plack_max_requests>75</plack_max_requests>
     <plack_workers>4</plack_workers>
    4) Stop plack
    5) Start plack
    6) Verify the number of works and max requests worked!

    address in the authorised range of IPs, the cookie should not contain

    Bug 17901: Fix possible SQL injection in shelf editing
    
    It has been reported that
    /cgi-bin/koha/opac-shelves.pl?op=edit&referer=view&shelfnumber=146&owner=4&shelfname=testX&sortfield=titleaaaaaa\`&category=1
    
    Could lead to SQL injection
    Actually it explodes because the generated SQL query is not correctly formated.
    
    However it would be good to limit the possible values for sortfield.
    
    This vulnerability has been reported by MDSec.

    Bug 17900: Fix possible SQL injection in patron cards template editing
    
    To recreate:
    /cgi-bin/koha/patroncards/edit-template.pl?op=edit&element_id=23%20and%201%3d2+union+all+select+1,user(),@@version+--%20
    
    Look at the Profile dropdown list.
    
    To fix this problem and to make sure it does not appears anywhere else
    in the label and patroncards modules, I have refactored the way the
    queries are built in C4::Creators::Lib
    Now all of the subroutine takes a hashref in parameters with a 'fields'
    and 'filters' parameters.
    From these 2 parameters the new internal subroutine _build_query will
    build the query and use placeholders.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Make sure you do not recreate the vulnerability with this patch
    applied.
    2/ With decent data in the labels and patroncards modules, compare all
    the different view (undef the New and Manage button groups) with and
    without this patch applied.
    => You should not see any differences.
    
    This vulnerability has been reported by MDSec.

    Bug 17986: Perl dependency evaluation incorrect
    
    It looks like I made a copy/paste error in a previous patch.
    
    While the fix was working when you pass the param "module" to
    version_info, it wasn't populating the version correctly
    for the "all" param, which causes koha_perl_deps.pl to
    think all OK modules actually need an upgrade.
    
    TEST PLAN
    
    0) Be on a system where you know your Koha Perl dependencies are
    mostly up-to-date
    
    1) Run ./koha_perl_deps.pl -a -c
    2) Note that most modules say they need an upgrade even when
    the installed version is the same as the minimum version
    
    3) Apply patch
    
    4) Run ./koha_perl_deps.pl -a -c
    5) Note that most moduls say they're OK, especially when the
    installed version is the same or greater than the minimum version

    Bug 17588: Koha::Patrons - Move GetMemberIssuesAndFines
    
    The GetMemberIssuesAndFines subroutine used to retrieve the issues,
    overdues and fines for a given patron. Most of the time, only 1 or 2 of
    these values were used.
    This patch removes this subroutine and uses the new get_issues,
    get_overdues and get_balance method from Koha::Patron and Koha::Account::Lines.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Add overdues, issues and fines to different patrons
    2/ On the checkout, checkin and patron search result and the patron
    detail pages, these 3 informations, if displayed before this patch, must be
    correctly displayed.
    3/ Use the batch patron deletion tool and make sure that patrons with a
    balance > 0 are not deleted

    Bug 17501: [Follow-up] QA Requests
    
    This patch makes the following changes, as requested by QA:
    
    [1] UploadedFile->delete always calls SUPER::delete.
        The return value normally comes from SUPER::delete; if removing the
        file failed, we return false. Two warns are kept.
        Since delete does no longer return the filename, a few changes were
        needed in tools/upload.pl.
    [2] Method getCategories is moved to UploadedFiles. Script tools/upload.pl
        now only contains one call. Added a use C4::Koha.
    [3] Calls UploadedFiles->delete as class method. As a result I removed
        method delete_errors for now; may be reconsidered on a new report.
    [4] Adjusted three ->search calls for id and public to ->find calls.
    [5] If you pass no id to upload.pl when deleting, you don't get an alert.
    
    All by all, we got rid of 15 lines !

    Bug 17501: Rename Upload to Uploader
    
    Why? Koha::Uploader now only contains the actual CGI upload. The new name
    better reflects its handler status.
    Pragmatically, the difference between Uploaded and Uploader makes it
    easier to specifically search for them in the codebase.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Upload.t.
    [2] Add an upload via the interface.
    [3] Check the code:
        git grep "Koha::Upload;"
        git grep "Koha::Upload\->"

    Bug 17501: Move getCategories and httpheaders from Upload.pm
    
    Class method getCategories has no strict binding to Upload.pm. While
    Upload.pm is now restricted to the actual uploading process with CGI
    hook, this routine fits better in the UploadedFile package.
    
    Class method httpheaders can be moved as well for the same reason. Note
    that it actually is an instance method. The parameter $name is dropped.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Upload.t.
    [2] Check the categories in the combo box of tools/upload.
    [3] Check a download via tools/upload and opac-retrieve-file.

    Bug 17501: Remove Koha::Upload::get from Koha::Upload
    
    The get routine actually returns records from uploaded_files. It should be
    possible to replace its calls by direct calls of Koha::UploadedFiles.
    
    This patch is the crux of this patch set. It deals with all scripts that
    use Koha::Upload.
    
    In the process we do:
    [1] Add a file_handle method to Koha::UploadedFile. This was previously
        arranged via the fh parameter of get.
    [2] Add a full_path method to UploadedFile. Previously returned in the
        path hash key of get. (Name is replaced by filename.)
    [3] Add a search_term method too (implementing get({ term => .. }).
        This logic came from _lookup.
    [4] Add a keep_file parameter to delete method. Only used in test now.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Upload.t
    [2] Go to Tools/Upload. Add an upload, download and delete.
    [3] Add another public upload , search for it.
        Use the hashvalue to download via opac with URL:
            cgi-bin/koha/opac-retrieve-file.pl?id=[hashvalue]
    [4] Go to Tools/Stage MARC for import. Import a marc file.
    [5] Go to Tools/Upload local cover image. Import an image file.
        Enable OPACLocalCoverImages to see result.
    [6] Test uploading a offline circulation file:
        Enable AllowOfflineCirculation, and create a koc file (plain text):
        Line1: Version=1.0\tA=1\tB=2
        Line2: 2016-11-23 16:00:00 345\treturn\t[barcode]
        Note: Replace tabs and barcode. The number of tabs is essential!
        Checkout the item with your barcode.
        Go to Circulation/Offline circulation file upload.
        Upload and click Apply directly.
        Checkout again. Repeat Offline circulation file upload.
        Now click Add to offline circulation queue.
    [7] Connect the upload plugin to field 856$u.
        Enable HTML5MediaEnabled.
        Upload a webm file via the plugin. Click Choose to save the URL,
        and put 'video/webm' into 856$q. Save the biblio record.
        Check if you see the media tab with player on staff detail.

    Bug 17501: Move Koha::Upload::delete to Koha::UploadedFile[s]
    
    Since delete is not part of the upload process, we will move it now
    to Koha::UploadedFile[s].
    Deleting the file will be done in UploadedFile.
    The (multiple) delete method in UploadedFiles refers to the single delete.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/Upload.t
        The warning ("but file was missing") in the last subtest is fine;
        the file did not exist. Will be addressed in a follow-up.
    [2] Search for uploads on Tools/Upload. Clone this tab (repeat search on
        a new tab in your browser).
    [3] Delete an existing upload on the first tab.
    [4] Try to delete it again on the second tab. Error message?
    [5] Bonus points:
        Add an upload. Mark the file immutable with chattr +i. Try to delete
        the file. You should see a "Could not be deleted"-message.

    One call of _lookup is replaced directly by Koha::UploadedFiles.

Date:   Tue Jun 14 16:00:58 2016 +0200

    Bug 16733: Add adjust_paths_dev_install to koha-functions.sh
    
    This new function checks koha-conf.xml for a given instance and if it
    contains a dev_install line, it adjusts PERL5LIB and KOHA_HOME
    accordingly. Otherwise it does not touch the values of these
    variables as normally read from /etc/default/koha-common.
    
    The function will be used in various debian scripts to allow for more
    flexibility with dev installs. And at the same time aiming to make better
    use of PERL5LIB and KOHA_HOME.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Add <dev_install>/not/there</dev_install> to your koha-conf.xml.
    [2] Run on the command line:
            PERL5LIB=test
            source [path-to-your-instance]/debian/scripts/koha-functions.sh
            echo $PERL5LIB
            adjust_paths_dev_install [name-of-your-instance]
            echo $PERL5LIB
        The last echo should be: /not/there
    [3] Remove the <dev_install> line and repeat step 2.

    Bug 17913: Remove possible duplicates in strict merge mode
    
    Since strict mode does not allow additional subfields that would make
    identical fields linked to the same authority different, there is no
    need to keep them while merging.
    
    We achieve this goal by simply:
    [1] Count the number of same fields linked to mergefrom in strict mode to
        eliminate duplicates.
    [2] Replaces the if-statement on auth_number by a next. (Tidy follows.)

    Bug 17913: Do not keep a cleared subfield in loose merge mode
    
    If you modify an authority and clear a specific subfield, you expect that
    merge respects your edit and clears this subfield too in the biblio
    records. It does in the new strict mode, but it does not yet in the
    default loose mode.
    
    This patch fixes that by adjusting the code around $exclude so that it
    uses a new hash skip_subfields, built from the reporting tags from the old
    and the new authority record.
    
    This is supported again by some changes in the unit test.

    Bug 17913: Fix the new field tag in merge when changing type
    
    Originally aimed for 9988, adjusted for this report.
    
    Old behavior was: pick the first tag. This is definitely wrong.
    If you (would) merge 610 to 611, you don't want to get a 111.
    
    This patch resolves the problem by determining the new tag in a small
    helper routine _merge_newtag, and corrects the position of the new field
    in the MARC record with append_fields_ordered. Too bad that MARC::Record
    does not have such a function; it looks like insert_fields_ordered, but
    it is different in case of multiple fields with the same tag.
    
    Note: These two small helper functions are not tested separately, since they
    should not be called outside of merge. They are implicitly tested by the
    adjusted tests in Merge.t.
    
    Note: In adding tests for this fix, I chose to simplify compare_field_count
    (no need for the pass parameter), and replace the pass parameter of sub
    compare_field_order by an exclude parameter, a hash of fields to exclude in
    counting fields.

    Bug 17909: Adding tests from bug 11315
    
    Based on original patch from Maxime Beaulieu on bug 11315.
    Amended by Marcel de Rooy on report 17909.
    
    EDIT:
    
    Original tests have been adjusted in view of:
    [1] Test on bug 11315 heavily leaned on DBD::Mock. Since we are
        using Test::DBIx::Class on such tests now, this would need attention.
        Moreover, the advantage of mocking the database in this case is at
        least arguable.
    [2] Matching the first (somewhat older) subtest of 11700.
    [3] Simplification and readability.
        Look e.g. at the use of $MARCto and $MARCfrom on 11315.
    
    This made me merge them in the db_dependent counterpart.
    
    Also note that this subtest adds another needed test case: the merge from
    auth1 to modified auth1, while 11700 tested auth1 to auth2.

    Just run t/db_dependent/Authorities/Merge.t

    Bug 17836: (ILSDI) Make GetPatronInfo fill 'charges' correctly
    
    This trivial fix corrects a typo on C4/ILSDI/Services.pm.
    It was hidden because the tests for ILSDI only cover the 'attributes'
    portion of the response. I added regression tests for this.
    
    To test:
    - Have the regression test patch applied
    - Run:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/ILSDI_Services.t
    => FAIL: Tests fail because 'charges' is always set to 1
    - Apply the patch
    - Run:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/ILSDI_Services.t
    => SUCCESS: Tests pass

    Bug 17726: TestBuilder - Add default values
    
    The items.more_subfields_xml is set to random data (generated by
    TestBuilder), and so GetMarcBiblio does not manage to embed items (if
    needed).
    
    The error is:
      :1: parser error : Start tag expected, '<' not found
    
    More precisely it explodes in
    C4::Items::_parse_unlinked_item_subfields_from_xml when
    MARC::Record->new_from_xml is called with an invalid xml
    
    This patch adds a default values mechanism to TestBuilder to avoid
    modifying all the existing calls.

    Bug 17469: Add missing sample notices to fr-CA web installer
    
    Adds missing notices to the fr-CA web installer:
    - MEMBERSHIP_EXPIRY
    - PASSWORD_RESET
    Renames RESERVESLIP to HOLD_SLIP
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
    1) Apply the first patch
    2) prove xt/sample_notices.t
       -- it should fail for fr-CA.
    3) Apply the second patch
    4) prove xt/sample_notices.t
       -- it should pass.
    5) run all tests (prove t; prove xt)
       -- they should generally pass
    6) run koha qa test tools
    
    NOTE: Split test patch from fix patch, so could prove problem
          exists easily.

    - Go to the OPAC and make sure you are not logged in
    - Click on the "Forgot your password?" link
    - Fill in "Login" and "Email" and click on "Submit"

    - The steps above will have added your user to the borrower_password_recovery
      table in the database. Delete it from there to make sure you start a
      fresh reset request.
    - Repeat the steps above and notice that the error is gone. You should

    Bug 17777: koha-remove should deal with temporary uploads
    
    If the temporary upload folder exists, it should be discarded when
    removing an instance. If we do not, it may/will create problems when
    recreating the same instance.
    
    A function in koha-functions.sh is added to determine the temp directory
    instead of hardcoding /tmp.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Copy koha-functions.sh to /usr/share/koha/bin
    [2] Run koha-create --create-db newinstancexx
    [3] Run mkdir /tmp/koha_newinstancexx_upload (if /tmp is your temp!)
    [4] Run debian/scripts/koha-remove newinstancexx
        Do not run the regular one, but verify that you use the updated one.
    [5] Check that /tmp/koha_newinstancexx_upload is gone.

    Bug 17914: Do not try and add the updated_on columns to the borrowers and deletedborrowers table
    
    Bug 10459 has been backported and the DB entry (add borrowers.updated_on and
    deletedborrower.updated_on) is now played in
      - 16.06.00.027
      - 16.05.00.002
      - 3.22.08.001
    
    This will raise a MySQL warning if the column already exists.
      DBD::mysql::db do failed: Duplicate column name 'updated_on'
    
    Since bug 17234 we have now a subroutine (C4::Installer::column_exists) to test
    if a column exists.
    When a DB entry modifying the DB structure is backported, it HAS TO check if the
    column, constraint or table exists before executing the query.
    
    Test plan:
    git checkout 3.22.x (16.05.x or 16.11.x)
    install Koha
    git checkout master
    execute the installer
    => Without this patch you will get a warning when adding borrowers.updated_on)
    => With this patch, you should not get it

    Bug 16239 [CSS Follow-up] Upgrade Bootstrap in the staff client
    
    This followup tweaks some CSS and markup in order to correct conflicts
    between default Bootstrap styles and the expected (previous) style of
    the staff client. Included:
    
    - Corrections to the widths of some modals.
    - Corrections to the style of the <pre> tag, seen often in MARC preview
      modals.
    - Corrections to the default active and hover states for dropdown menus.
    
    To test, apply the patch and view various pages which use Bootstrap
    modals, confirming that they look correct.
    
    - Add order from staged file MARC preview
    - Add order from external source MARC preview
    - Cataloging record merge MARC preview
    - Batch record modification MARC preview
    - Authorities Z39.50 search MARC preview

    Bug 17196: Move marcxml out of the biblioitems table
    
    Two discussions on koha-devel lead to the same conclusion:
    biblioitems.marcxml should be moved out this table
    - biblio and biblioitems
    http://lists.koha-community.org/pipermail/koha-devel/2013-April/039239.html
    - biblioitems.marcxml & biblioitems.marc / HUGE performance issue !
    http://lists.koha-community.org/pipermail/koha-devel/2016-July/042821.html
    
    There are several goals to do it:
    - Performance
    As Paul Poulain wrote, a simple query like
      SELECT publicationyear, count(publicationyear) FROM biblioitems GROUP BY publicationyear;
    takes more than 10min on a DB with more than 1M bibliographic records
    but only 3sec (!) on the same DB without the biblioitems.marcxml field
    Note that priori to this patch set, the biblioitems.marcxml was not
    retrieved systematically, but was, at least, in
    C4::Acquisition::GetOrdersByBiblionumber and C4::Acquisition::GetOrders
    - Flexibility
    Storing the marcxml in a specific table would allow use to store several
    kind of metadata (USMARC, MARCXML, MIJ, etc.) and different formats (marcflavour)
    - Clean code
    It would be a first step toward Koha::MetadataRecord for bibliographic
    records (not done in this patch set).
    
    Test plan:
    - Update the DBIC Schema
    - Add / Edit / Delete / Import / Export bibliographic records
    - Add items
    - Reindex records using ES
    - Confirm that the following scripts still work:
        * misc/cronjobs/delete_records_via_leader.pl
        * misc/migration_tools/build_oai_sets.pl
    - Look at the reading history at the OPAC (opac-readingrecord.pl)
    - At the OPAC, click on a tag, you must see the result
    
    Note: Changes in Koha/OAI/Server/ListRecords.pm is planned on bug 15108.

    Bug 17629: Koha::Biblio - Remove ModBiblioframework
    
    There is only one call to C4::Biblio::ModBiblioframework, it's called
    just before C4::Biblio::ModBiblio in cataloguing/addbiblio.pl
    At first glance this call does not seems useful: all the subroutines
    called from ModBiblio send the frameworkcode in parameter.
    
    I'd go to remove it, but I'd like to get confirmation by others.
    
    No test plan here, you need a good pair of eyes and deep into the
    C4::Biblio code.

    Bug 17486: Remove Mozilla Persona
    
    Persona never really took off, and although many browsers currently
    support it, very few services actually implement it.
    
    This has lead to it's founders, Mozilla, to end the project. In their
    own words:
    
    =============================================================================
    Persona is no longer actively developed by Mozilla. Mozilla has
    committed to operational and security support of the persona.org
    services until November 30th, 2016.
    
    On November 30th, 2016, Mozilla will shut down the persona.org services.
    Persona.org and related domains will be taken offline.
    
    If you run a website that relies on Persona, you need to implement an
    alternative login solution for your users before this date.
    
    For more information, see this guide to migrating your site away from
    Persona:
    
    https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_Shutdown_Guidelines_for_Reliers
    
    =============================================================================
    
    Given the above, and that the Persona authentication methods as a whole
    are no longer being actively maintained by anyone anywhere to ensure
    ongoing security, we should deprecate the option from koha.
    
    Test plan:
    Apply this patch and make sure you do not find any references of Persona
    Have a look at patches from bug 9587 and confirm that everything has
    been reverted

    Bug 16083 Allow cli overrides for makefile settings.
    
    Currently the Makefile.pl script only accepts the '--prev-install-log' commandline flag for reading Koha configuration values from the previous installation.
    
    The Makefile does not have help output.
    
    The aim of this bug report is to add 2 things:
    - --help output
    - commandline parameters that should allow automating many of the common settings if desired
    - when commandline parameters are not passed we simply fall back to the interactive method of old
    
    Test Plan:
    
    - Run the Makefile without parameters ‚Äî the script should work as before.
    - Run the script with the '-h' flag ‚Äî it should output help.
    - Run the script with any number of additional legal flags ‚Äî the script should skip those questions in its interactive mode.

    Bug 6782 - Move auto member cardnumber generation to occur when record is "Saved" (avoid collisions).
    
    Currently the card number is generated when the user enters the patron creation form. This creates a problem of concurrency - when two or more simulataneous users are registering members, the error "card no. in use" can occur.
    
    This change moves the card number generation to occur after the "Save" button is pressed.
    
    Changes:
    -C4/Members.pm:
    Added code to fixup_cardnumber,If the cardnumber is blank and "autoMemberNum" ON.
    -koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/members/memberentrygen.tt:
    Added code to display "leave blank for auto calc during registration" in cardnumber label in patron registration form only if "autoMemberNum" ON.
    -members/memberentry.pl:
    Added code to get weather or not "autoMemberNum" is on or off and removed fixup_cardnumber generation.
    
    Test cases:
    -If "autoMemberNum" ON:
    ->In blank case, must generate auto card number in simulataneous users.
    ->If user entered, check for unique card number.
    
    -If "autoMemberNum" OFF:
    Must work normal.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.
    Note: Syspref PorrowerMandatoryField must not include cardnumber, otherwise
          you can not save. Maybe that should be mentioned in the comment for
          syspref autoMemberNum.

    Bug 17778 - Make "Earliest Registered Date" in OAI dynamic
    
    This was hardcoded to 0001-01-01.
    
    To test:
    - Make sure you have a couple of records, with different timestamps
    - Enable OAI-PMH
    - Check http://localhost:2201/cgi-bin/koha/oai.pl?verb=Identify
      and verify that "Earliest Registered Date" is 0001-01-01
    - Apply the patch
    - Re-check the "Earliest Registered Date" and verify that it is now
      the lowest timestamp in your biblio table
    - Manipulate the timestamps and verify that "Earliest Registered Date"
      changes accordingly
    - Sign off!

    Bug 17265 - Make koha-create-defaults less greedy
    
    koha-create-defaults substitutes the instance name with the placeholder
    __KOHASITE__ in the SQL file that it creates. If the instance name is
    something common, like "data", this means that way too many substitutions
    will be made, and when koha-create uses the SQL file as a template, broken
    data can be the result.
    
    The solution in this patch was suggested by drojf on IRC.
    
    To test:
    - Create an instance called "data"
    - Run "sudo koha-dump-defaults data > test.sql"
    - Take a look at test.sql and verify there are way too many occurences
      of __KOHASITE__, like "-- Dumping __KOHASITE__ for table `accountlines`"
    - Apply the patch
    - Copy the resulting koha-create and koha-dump-defaults to somewhere
      running off the packages
    - Run "sudo koha-dump-defaults data > test.sql" again and verify there
      are only 4 occurrences of __KOHASITE__, in places that make sense
    - Create an instance with something like:
      $ gzip test.sql
      $¬†sudo koha-create --create-db --defaultsql test.sql.gz test17265
    - Verify that you have a working Koha install

    Bug 17766 - Patron notification does not work with multi item holds
    
    This patch fixes notification when same biblio has multiple reserves with same borrower,
    introduced in Bug 14695. C4::Reserves::ModReserveAffect uses internal method
    _koha_notify_reserve but sends itemnumber and biblionumber instead of record_id.
    
    To test:
    Prerequisites:
    - One biblio with two items attached
    - A patron with hold_filled notification activated
    - A letter for HOLD with <<reserves.reserve_id>> in it
    1) Place two reservations on same biblio
    2) checkin item x on pickup branch, observe patron message generated
    3) checkin item y on pickup branch, observe patron message generated
    4) note that reserve_id is the same on both messages, which is wrong
    5) apply this patch and repeat 1-3
    6) now observe notifications have correct (different) reserve_id

    Bug 17870 - Call to include file incorrectly moved into the footer
    
    This patch moves a line of template code from js_includes.inc back into
    doc-head-close.inc where it belongs.
    
    To test, apply the patch and view a page which uses a template that
    depends on html_helpers.inc being processed. For example:
    
    - The set library page
    - The holds queue report
    - The new patron form
    
    The pages should work correctly.

    Bug 17725: Do not copy subfield's content when cloning
    
    To replicate:
    - Open an existing record in your catalog
    - Create another field or subfield of a field/subfield already used using the icon to repeat it
    - Verify that the content is copied over
    - Verify this happens for input (one line) and textare (multiple lines)
    
    I can't make this happen for when creating a new record, but more consistently on editing existing records.
    
    This is rather annoying when cataloguing in Koha, as the cataloguer has to empty the field first and that adds an extra step for each repeated field.
    
    Test plan:
    Confirm than the content is not copied when you clone a field or a subfield.

    Bug 17817: Fix cloning subfields using select2
    
    Based on Jonathan's patch (the DO NOT PUSH one), I put together this fix.
    What was changed is that select2 is reinitialized only after the cloned element
    has been appended to the DOM (so that select2 can correctly calculate the field's
    width). Also, I changed the selectors that searched for the line divs (for reordering)
    and for the subfield's input element (for erasing the field's value) to be more specific,
    since select2 introduced divs that broke some assumptions about the expected HTML structure

    Bug 17234: Need to separate KEY and FOREIGN KEY checks
    
    In the previous patch we use the constraint_exists subroutine to verify
    if an index or a foreign key exists.
    But the `SHOW INDEX` query does not return foreign keys (as its name
    suggests!).
    We need another subroutine foreign_key_exists to check the FK existence.
    
    I have found that because t/db_dependent/TestBuilder.t fails on
    oai_sets_biblios, because oai_sets_biblios_ibfk_1 has not been removed.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Do not apply this patch
    1/ Use a 3.20 DB
    2/ update the DB
    3/ SHOW CREATE TABLE oai_sets_biblios
    will display oai_sets_biblios_ibfk_1
    
    Apply the patch and repeat 1, 2, 3
    => Will not display oai_sets_biblios_ibfk_1
    It has been removed as expected.

    Bug 15879: Allow multiple plugin directories to be defined in koha-conf.xml
    
    It would be very useful to be able to define multiple plugin directories
    in the Koha conf file. This would allow for ease of plugin development
    so that each plugin installed can live in its own git repository. For
    compatibility, the first plugindir instance defined should be the one
    used for uploading plugins via the web interface.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Define a second pluginsdir line in your koha-conf.xml
    3) Clone the kitchen sink plugin to this new path like this:
       git clone https://github.com/bywatersolutions/koha-plugin-kitchen-sink.git /path/to/new/plugins/dir
    4) Restart memcached if you are running it
    5) The Kitchen Sink plugin should now appear in your list of plugins!

    Bug 15897 - Folowup Revert "Bug 15896: [QA Follow-up] Add accountlines_id parameter in paycollect"
    
    This reverts commit b6d5748c001febc5acd67938d12ba25844d11fbc.
    
    As this bug report no more uses the accounline_id parameter to identify
    account lines to pay in Koha::Account->pay, it should revert this, to
    use the new notation everywhere.

    Bug 17830: CSRF - Handle unicode characters in userid
    
    If the userid of the logged in user contains unicode characters, the token
    will not be generated correctly and Koha will crash with:
      Wide character in subroutine entry at /usr/share/perl5/Digest/HMAC.pm line 63.
    
    Test plan:
    - Edit a superlibrarian user and set his/her userid to '‚ù§' or any other strings
    with unicode characters.
    - Login using this patron
    - Search for patrons and click on a result.
    
    => Without this patch, you will get a software error (with "Wide
    character in subroutine entry" in the logs).
    => With this patch, everything will go fine
    
    You can also test the other files modified by this patch.

    Bug 17569: Koha::Patrons - Move GetUpcomingMembershipExpires to search_upcoming_membership_expires
    
    This patchset moves the C4::Members::GetUpcomingMembershipExpires
    subroutine code to the Koha::Patrons->search_upcoming_membership_expires
    method.
    This subroutine was used from only 1 place, so it's an easier to move.
    
    Test plan:
    Use the membership_expiry.pl cronjob script using the different
    options.
    The behavior should be the same as prior to this patch.

    Bug 17767: Make Koha::Patron::Modification handle extended attributes
    
    This patch makes Koha::Patron::Modification aware of the new extended_attributes
    column, which is expected to contain valid JSON data.
    
    The ->store method is modified so it validates the field value (i.e. the content
    is decoded using the JSON library) and raises a convenient exception in case of
    failure.
    
    This behaviour change is covered by the provided unit tests.

    Bug 17679: C4::Circulation - Remove unused GetItemIssues
    
    Ready for an archaeology course?
    
    C4::Circulation::GetItemIssues is only used once, from
    catalogue/issuehistory.pl
    This call has been added by
      commit 95d6452462a560ba0c0ac859a2cfb7783c25c925
        Adding some more information on issuehistory.
    which says "Adding itemnumber to issuehistory.pl API so that one could search
    for issuehistory of a specific item."
    So it added the ability to see the item issue history but did not
    provide a way to access it via the interface.
    It's ok so far but this subroutine is broken since
      commit aa114f53499b9cffde0571fe7e08622f9c9a332a
        Bug 5549 : Only use DateTime for issues table
    because of this change:
    -    my $today = C4::Dates->today('iso');
    +    my $today = DateTime->now( time_zome => C4::Context->tz);
    
    I let you catch the typo ;)
    And since this commit the subroutine explodes with "The following
    parameter was passed in the call to DateTime::from_epoch but was not
    listed in the validation options: time_zome"
    
    Since it has never been raised by someone and that the feature is
    hidden, I'd recommend to simply remove it.
    
    Note that the "Checked out from" column would have been wrong even if we
    fixed all the previous issue.
    
    Test plan:
    Just dig into the code and confirm what this commit message tells

    Bug 17785: Fix OAI-PMH's XSLT-generated URLs under Plack
    
    Look at e.g. the URL for Show More at the end of the output of Records or
    Identifiers. If you use Plack, you will see that it refers to
    yourserver:/opac/oai.pl, which is not correct.
    
    This is caused by using CGI's self_url in combination with script alias,
    mounting point, etc. Note that we cannot solve this problem in the code of
    Koha only. Since HTTP::OAI modules also call self_url, we still end up
    with some wrong url's.
    
    Instead of a larger architectural operation on Apache and Plack config files,
    this patch adjusts the final xslt transformation on the OAI response.
    It hardcodes the correct path only once, in a xslt variable. And replaces
    all oai:OAI-PMH/oai:request/text() calls, containing wrong URLs, by this
    variable.
    
    Test plan:
    Run oai.pl. Try the various verbs.
    Verify that the URLs point to /cgi-bin/koha/oai.pl.

    Bug 17781 - Improper branchcode set during renewal
    
    For no discernable reason, when AddIssue calls AddRenewal, it passes the
    branchcode generated from _GetCircControlBranch. Assume
    _GetCircControlBranch is set to return items.homebranch. So:
    1) If an item owned by LibraryA is checked out at LibraryB, the
      statistic line branchcode will be LibraryB
    2) If an item is renewed via the ajax datatables renewal function, the
      statistic line branchcode will be LibraryB the
    3) If an item is renewed via scanning the item into the checkout again,
      statistic line branchcode will be *LibraryA*
    
    This is clearly improper behavior. The renewal is taking place at
    LibraryB, so the branchcode passed to AddRenewal should be LibraryB,
    the logged in library. This also jives with the documentation for
    the subroutine.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Set CircControl to "the library the item is from" aka ( ItemHomeLibrary )
    2) Set HomeOrHoldingBranch to 'The library the items is from" ( aka homebranch )
    3) Create item with homebranch of LibraryA and holdingbranch of LibraryB
    4) Set the logged in library to LibraryB
    4) Check the item out to a patron at LibraryB
    5) Note the statistics line has a branchcode of LibraryB
    6) Check the item out again to trigger a renewal, renew the item
    7) Note the statistic line has a branchcode of LibraryA!
    8) Apply this patch
    9) Repeat step 6
    10) Note the statistics line has a branchcode of LibraryB!

    Bug 17742: Fix t/db_dependent/Patrons.t
    
    Moves the getting of testing date for updated_on just after the storing
    the test patron data to make the gap between generating data and now
    date as short as possible
    
    Fixes test 7
    
    Use Koha::Database instead of C4::Context->dbh
    
    Test plan
    1. prove t/db_dependent/Patrons.t
    2. read the diff
    
    NOTE: Only minor improvement could be using test builder to
          generate the category and branch codes, rather than assume
          data exists. However, that is beyond scope of this bug.

    Bug 17246: Do no support arrayref to define multiple FK
    
    Currently you can call GetPreparedLetter like:
    
    $prepared_letter = GetPreparedLetter(
        (
            module      => 'test',
            letter_code => 'TEST_HOLD',
            tables      => {
                reserves => [ $fk1, $fk2 ],
            },
        )
    );
    
    It assumes that $fk1 is a borrowernumber and $fk2 a biblionumber.
    It seems hazardous to do this guess.
    
    I suggest to remove this feature and only allow hashref indeed.

    If no dateofbirthrequired or upperagelimit is set on the interface, the

    For INT field, we must explicitely set these empty value to undef
    instead to avoid MySQL 5.7 (and strict mode) to raise:

    Bug 17783: Optimize Koha::IssuingRules->get_effective_issuing_rule
    
    This patch modifies method get_effective_issuing_rule in Koha::IssuingRules
    aiming to optimize the search for matching issuing rule.
    
    Before this patch, in worst case scenario, we have had to make a SELECT query
    eight times. This will have a negative impact on performance where-ever we need
    to find matching issuing rule multiple times, if the search is not directly
    matching an issuing rule on the first query.
    
    This patch makes get_effective_issuing_rule have a stable performance on both
    best and worst case, whereas the old method was really fast on the best case
    and really slow on the worst case.
    
    However, this patch slightly lowers the performance for best case, where matching
    issuing rule is found instantly before (branchcode, categorycode and itemtype all
    are specifically defined in issuing rules). For all other cases this patch offers
    a performance improvement.
    
    To test:
    1. Run t/db_dependent/Koha/IssuingRules.t and compare the results with previous
       tests.

    Bug 16933 - Alt-Y not working on "Please confirm checkout" dialogs
    
    This patch changes the keyboard shortcut for renew from Alt+y to Alt+w.
    
    To test:
    1) Press Alt+y when you get a "Please confirm checkout" dialog.
    2) The renew tab is selected instead of confirming the dialog.
    3) Apply the patch and refresh your browser to load the change.
    4) Repeat step one.
    5) Alt+y confirms the checkout, Alt+w selects the renew tab.

    Bug 16914: Rely on TT for newlines
    
    The translation scripts have an historical tendency to chomp newlines
    and we introduced an empty_line.inc file to force newlines when building
    CSV output out of our templates (in item search and late orders).
    
    This patch makes the mentioned templates use TT ability to force newlines
    plus some misuses of the 'minus' sign.
    
    Test plan:
    - Apply the patch
    - Do an item search that returns more than one result
    - Export as CSV
    => SUCCESS: The CSV file is correctly formed.
    - Install any translation:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev
     k$ cd kohaclone/misc/translator
     k$ perl translate install <chosen language>
    - Enable <chosen language> (e.g. es-ES)
    - Repeat the item search
    - Export as CSV
    => SUCCESS: The CSV file is correctly formed in your chosen language.
    - Have more than one late orders (bummer)
    - Go to late orders
    - Choose them
    - Export as CSV (in english)
    => SUCCESS: The CSV file is correctly formed.
    - Switch language
    - Go to late orders
    - Choose them
    - Export as CSV (in english)

    Bug 17764: (bug 17556 follow-up) Fix search for logged out users and lost items
    
    If you are non logged-in and you the search result contain lost items,
    you will get:
    Can't call method "category" on an undefined value at
    /home/liz/koha-src/koha/C4/Search.pm line 2091.
    
    This is because bug 17556 assumed that $userenv was not defined when the
    user is logged out. Actually it is, with non defined or empty string
    values.
    
    Test plan:
    Do a search in the opac that would turn up a whole list of results (and
    not just that one) with the lost item included.
     => Without this patch you should get an error
     => With this patch applied you should see the search results

    Bug 17743: Item search - Fix indexes build on MARC
    
    Searching items by custom search fields does not work because these
    fields are not correctly processed in JS.
    
    In case of custom search field, the parent of the option is not the
    select but the optgroup element.
    
    Test plan:
    Create a custom search field on 245$c for instance
    On the items search form, select this field and launch a search
    => Without this patch, the results will not be filtered and you will get
    all your items

    In ODLIS the word Issue is never used in the sense we use it. Another
    problem with Issue is it has so many meaning in English (such as
    problem/bug)
    The word Checkout *is* in ODLIS, closer to what we use:
    http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_c.aspx#checkoutslip

    Bug 17578: GetMemberDetails - Remove authflags - 2
    
    This script is not used from the Koha codebase and does not seem very
    useful.
    We could rewrite it if needed later (ie. if someone complains I will
    rewrite it).

    Bug 17578: GetMemberDetails - Remove authflags - 1
    
    GetMemberDetails create a authflags key, but this key is only used from
    2 different places.
    One is a very simple script, which does not seem very usefull
    C4/SIP/interactive_members_dump.pl. I propose to simply remove it.
    The other one is the member-flags.pl script. What is done in this one is
    a bit weird since we a doing twice the same query (it was not highlighted
    before this patch). We will need to fix that later.
    At the moment the goal it to remove the GetMemberDetails subroutine
    without introducing any regressions (and so without adding big changes)
    
    Test plan:
    Select/unselect permissions for a patron, save and edit again.
    The behavior of the permission checkboxes should be ok

    Bug 17578: GetMemberDetails - Remove BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions
    
    The correct way to get the value of BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions from a
    patron object is to get the patron category then call the
    effective_BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions:
      $patron->category->effective_BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions
    
    So this patch applies this change and remove this value from the
    GetMemberDetails subroutine.

    Bug 17418 - Move staff client home page JavaScript to the footer
    
    This patch alters the header and footer include files so that JavaScript
    can be included in either one or the other. As a proof of concept, the
    staff client home page is updated to include JS in the footer instead
    of the header.
    
    The processing of JavaScript included on individual pages can now be
    similar to how it is done in the OPAC. A block is created with the
    page's JavaScript which is then processed in js_includes.inc in the
    correct order, after other required js assets.
    
    On pages which have been modified to allow JavaScript to be moved to the
    footer you must add a variable to the template: [% SET footerjs = 1 %].
    Eventually all staff client templates should be modified so that setting
    a flag is not required.
    
    "[% MACRO jsinclude BLOCK %]" is used instead of "[% BLOCK %]" and "[%
    PROCESS %]" because MACRO allows the template directives to be
    processed correctly when included by intranet-bottom.inc.
    
    To test, apply the patch and view the staff client home page.
    
    - Confirm that you get a confirmation when deleting a news item from the
      home page.
    - Enable the CircAutocompl system preference and test that patron
      autocomplete works from the "Check out" tab from the staff home page
      and from other pages where the "Check out" tab is present.
    - Test that JavaScript is working correctly on other pages like
      Circulation, Preferences, etc.

    Bug 17761 - Renewing or returning item via the checkouts table causes lost and damaged statuses to disappear
    
    Due to the fact that the lost and damaged status are contained within the due_due span,

    Some librarians find this disconcerting and it seems that it would be better to keep the visible.

    2) Renew that lost item via the checkouts table
    3) Notice the lost status disappears from that row
    4) Apply this patch
    5) Refresh the page ( you may want to clear your browser cache as well )

    The config file is read in <installdir>/etc/sms/driver/<driver>.yaml.

    file has to be in <installdir>/etc/sms/driver/UK/Kapow.yaml

    Bug 17547: (MARC21|NORMARC) have Chronological term field $9 indexed
    
    This patch makes Zebra index the 648$9 link for chronological terms on
    bibliographic records. This way an authority search on chronological terms
    will show the right number in 'Used in X records' message.
    
    To test:
    - Have a record with a 648 field, linked to an authority record (i.e. with an authid on 648$9).
    - Search for the record, notice it is indexed.
    - Perform an authority search for the chronological term
    => FAIL: the term is linked to our record, but koha shows '0' count.
    - Apply the patch
    - Run:
      $ cd kohaclone
      $ xsltproc etc/zebra/xsl/koha-indexdefs-to-zebra.xsl \
           etc/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-koha-indexdefs.xml \
         > etc/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl
      $ git diff
    => SUCCESS: Notice the shipped etc/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl
       is up-to-date
    - Run:
      $ sudo cp etc/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl \
                /etc/koha/zebradb/marc_defs/marc21/biblios/biblio-zebra-indexdefs.xsl
      $ sudo koha-restart-zebra kohadev
      $ sudo koha-rebuild-zebra -f -b -v kohadev
    - Search for the record, notice it is indexed.
    - Perform an authority search for the chronological term
    => SUCCESS: the term is linked to our record, usage count is 1
    - Sign off :-D
    
    I assume NORMARC is similar on this regard. Feel free to fail it if the NORMARC part of the
    patch is wrong.

    See also bug 17733. As long as we have no FK, these invalid guarantorid's
    can make tests fail.
    Adding a sql statement to clear them in the beginning of the test.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Since it seems that AUTO_INC+8, +9 and +10 may fail one or two tests,
        we should manipulate one or two borrowers:
        Run this SQL query first:
    SELECT `AUTO_INCREMENT` FROM  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = '[your database]' and table_name='borrowers';
        Now run: UPDATE borrowers SET guarantorid=[former value + 8] WHERE borrowernumber=[some existing borrowernumber]
    [2] Without this patch, run Members.t. Should fail two tests.
    [3] Apply the patch. Fetch the new AUTO_INCREMENT value and update
        guarantorid accordingly again for the manipulated borrower.
    [4] Run the test. It should not fail.

    Bug 17666: Revert "Bug 16685 [QA Followup] - Use Path::Tiny::slurp instead of File::Slurp"
    
    This reverts commit 7ac1bc35372990520a7c67870b2c702c41bbebcc.
    
    On a kohadevbox:
    Error flock (1) on
    '/home/vagrant/kohaclone/installer/data/mysql/atomicupdate/bug_xxxx.perl':
    No locks available at installer/data/mysql/updatedatabase.pl line 13637.
    
    This is because Path::Tiny->slurp[_utf8] uses flocks which does not work
    with NFS
    
    Test plan:
    Execute a .perl atomic update file on a kohadevbox
    => Without this patch you should get the flock error
    => With this patch the update should work fine

    Bug 11274 Sent Notices Tab Not Working Correctly
    
    This patch implements the notices toggle event using a different method.
    Using on() lets us bind the event to a parent element, allowing the
    event to attach to elements which may not exist on the page yet.
    
    Test plan the same as original patch:
    
    1) have a patron with more then 20 notices sent
    2) go to patron profile -> notices
    -> without patch, the showing/hidding of notices content does work
    correctly only on first loaded page
    -> with patch, it should work correctly everywhere - try to use
    paginator, searching, ordering....

    Bug 14541: Do not truncate tax rate values
    
    Tax rates are stored in decimal(6,4) fields which means that 4 decimals
    are allowed.
    If a tax rate is 8.42%, it is stored as 0.0842
    If a tax rate has more precision than that, Koha won't deal correctly
    with it. We will need to update the DB structure.
    
    With this patch, the tax rate will be displayed with the same precision
    as in the DB. So if you enter 8.42, you will see 8.42% instead of 8.4%
    without this patch.
    
    Test plan:
    Do a full acquisition workflow with a tax rate like 8.42% and confirm
    that it is correctly displayed.

    Bug 16376 - Koha::Calendar->is_holiday date truncation creates fatal errors for TZ America/Santiago
    
    Using a DateTime object with a timezone of America/Santiago
    was causing fatal errors for Koha::Calendar->is_holiday
    and Koha::Calendar->exception_holidays, when the objects
    were truncated to an invalid local time.
    
    Using a floating zone allows us to use the same day, month, year
    for comparison purposes without running into the possibility of
    creating an invalid local time and thus a fatal software error.
    
    Edit:
    
    While the changes to is_holiday and single_holiday make sense (Jonathan agrees too)
    I didn't manage to have them fail, because truncate is not failing in my trials, but
    days_between. So to me, it narrows down to have exception_holiday return floating tz
    datetime objects so it doesn't break days_between.
    
    Anyway, it is ok to push this patch, and the regression test I provide covers this scenario
    I'm describing.
    
    To test:
    - Apply the regression tests patch
    - Run:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/Holidays.t
    => FAIL: Unexpected error due to bad timezone/date combination
    - Apply this patch

    good sample data for its tests. It does so by creating a random
    itemtype.
    
    To test:
    - Run
      $ prove t/db_dependent/CourseReserves.t
    => FAIL: lots of warnings about "item-level_itypes set but no itemtype
      set for item"
    - Apply the patch
    - Run:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/CourseReserves.t
    => SUCCESS: Tests are green, and no warnings.

    Bug 17395 - exporting checkouts in CVS generates a file with wrong extension
    
    In checkouts table, the is an export form (when some exports syspref are enabled).
    Export using a CSV profile will create a file with name koha.mrc (same as ISO2709 export).
    It would be better with koha.csv.
    
    Bug 14647 manages the export page, this but will only manage for export from checkouts table where file name is hard-coded.
    
    Test plan :
    - Enable checkouts exports by setting syspref ExportWithCsvProfile with a profile for record export
    - Go to circ page of a patron with checkouts : /cgi-bin/koha/circ/circulation.pl?borrowernumber=xxx
    - Show checkouts table
    - Select some checkboxes in "Export" column
    - Select "CSV" in export format combo-box
    - Click on "Export"
    => Without patch, the generated file is koha.mrc
    => With patch, the generated file is koha.csv
    - Check ISO2709 export generates a file named koha.mrc

    Bug 16873: Improve renewal error messages on self check
    
    When a patron is not allowed to renew from the self check module, the
    only message displayed is "No renewals allowed".
    It would be nicer to let him/her know that the renewal is not allowed
    because it's a on-site checkout or automatic renewal.
    
    To do so we can call CanBookBeRenewed instead of CanBookBeIssued and get
    the renewal error.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Switch off AllowSelfCheckReturns
    1/ check out an item and tick "auto renewal"
    2/ Go on the self check module
    => auto renewal message is displayed
    3/ check out an item and tick "on-site checkout"
    4/ Go on the self check module
    => on-site checkout message is displayed
    5/ check out an item without ticking any checkboxes (regular checkout)
    Renew it to reach the max renew allowed
    6/ Go on the self check module
    => regular checkout message is displayed
    7/ Switch on AllowSelfCheckReturns and repeat previous steps
    => "Return this item" button is displayed in addition of the renewal
    error message

    Bug 14699: Fix intranet search history issues due to pagination
    
    DataTables removes hidden rows from the DOM. Because of that, "Select
    all", "Clear all" and the form submission don't work correctly
    (basically they act only on the currently displayed page).
    
    This patch fixes just that.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Go to your search history page
    2/ Make you sure you have at least 21 entries in your search history. If
    not, do some searches and come back here.
    3/ Click "Select all" and change page. The checkboxes on the new page
    should be checked.
    4/ Check some checkboxes on this new page and click "Clear all". Go back
    to the previous page, checkboxes shouldn't be checked.
    5/ Check some checkboxes on at least 2 different pages and click
    "Delete". All selected search history entries should be deleted.
    
    Followed test plan. Works as expected.

    Bug 17676: Update default COLLATE of marc_subfield_structure
    
    (This issue has been raised on bug 17216 comments 93-103)
    On bug 11944 (3.19.00.006) we updated the default COLLATE for all our tables to
    utf8_unicode_ci but not the marc_subfield_structure table.
    Indeed we want to keep tagsubfield a utf8_bin (to allow lowercase and uppercase
    of the same letter for subfields).
    We should have set the default collate to utf8_unicode_ci for further changes.
    
    This patch updates the DB entry 3.19.00.006 to set the default COLLATE to this
    table (for people upgrading from prior to 3.19.00.006) and set this
    default COLLATE on 16.06.00.033 (for people upgrading from after 3.19.00.006).
    
    The error is:
    DBD::mysql::db do failed: Can't create table `koha_kohadev`.`#sql-306_9f9` (errno: 150 "Foreign key constraint is incorrectly formed") [for Statement "

    This db rev reapplies dbrev 3.15.00.049 in case that one failed due to
    existence of issn_idx.
    
    Test plan:
    If you do not have index issn_idx, recreate it:
        ALTER TABLE biblioitems ADD INDEX issn_idx (issn (255))
    Run this db rev. You should see: Removed issn_idx.
    Rerun the dbrev. You should see: Everything is fine.

    Bug 8835: Drop issn_idx for completeness
    
    When dbrev 3.15.00.049 failed, the still existing issn_idx must have
    been the cause.
    This patch only adjusts the old db rev.
    Still thinking if we also need a new db rev to fix isbn and issn for
    those installs where 3.15.00.049 failed too. (In that case the fields
    may not have been changed to mediumtext and no indexes were added.)
    
    Test plan:
    Ideally, run an upgrade from something older than 3.15.00.49.
    But running the added sql command from the command line might convince
    you too.

    Bug 17278: Use available limit when requesting zebra when ccl query is used
    
    When a ccl query is used, the buildQuery subroutine does not handle
    the available limit (not an index).
    This available limit is handle later in the subroutine.
    This affect the author links on the detail page for instance (an=xx).
    A much better solution would be to keep an 'available' zebra index up-to-date.
    
    Test plan:
    (OPAC or staff interface, it does not matter)
    - Launch a search, click on a result and then on an author link to
      launch another query (an:xx)
    - Limit to available items without the 'facet'
    => Without this patch you won't get any results
    => With this patch applied you should get relevant result (regarding the
    known bugs 16970, 13715, 13658, 5463, etc.)

    Bug 17663: Forgotten userpermissions from bug 14686
    
    Bug 14686 added in a dbrev:
        (13, 'upload_general_files', 'Upload any file'),
        (13, 'upload_manage', 'Manage uploaded files');
    
    But these were not added in userpermissions.sql somehow :)
    So, what now?
    
    This patch:
    [1] adds them to userpermissions.sql as should have been done,
    [2] adds a dbrev to add them for newer installs that did not run the
        14686 dbrev.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run this sql statement:
        DELETE FROM permissions WHERE code = 'upload_general_files' OR
            code = 'upload_manage'
    [2] Run the db rev.
    [3] Check if you see Tools/Upload (with sufficient perms).

    Bug 17419: Fix smsalertnumber and mobile confusion in moremember.pl
    
    members/moremember.pl will set mobile number as smsalertnumber in template if
    smsalertnumber is not defined. This will cause incorrect display for SMS number
    in patron's Details-tab. This confusion between smsalertnumber and mobile is
    already fixed in Bug 14683, but members/moremember.pl was not fixed yet.
    
    This is a minor issue since it won't occur for manually added new patrons due to
    fixes already pushed in Bug 14683, but in case patron's smsalertnumber is null
    in database, this bug can be replicated:
    
    To test:
    1. Set EnhancedMessagingPreferences to "Allow" and make sure SMSSendDriver
       has been set.
    2. Add a new patron, give it a mobile/other phone number.
    3. Run a SQL query:
       update koha.borrowers set smsalertnumber=NULL where borrowernumber=XXX;
       (replace XXX with your new patron's borrowernumber)
    4. Go to patron's details tab and observe that SMS number shows the mobile/
       other phone you provided earlier.
    5. Apply patch.
    6. Refresh patron's details tab.
    7. Observe that smsalertnumber is now empty, as it should be.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    3) Its ID is B_address - a duplicate within the code in fact
    4) Apply the patch
    5) Repeat steps 1 and 2
    6) The ID is unique now: B_streetnumber

    Bug 17601 - Regression: Incomplete CSS update introduced by Bug 14610
    
    Bug 14610 revised staff-global.css so that the "holdcount" class was
    renamed "number_box." That's good. It's good to have something more
    generic since the class is used in multiple places.
    
    The problem is that there are still several instances of the "holdcount"
    class in the templates which should have been updated at the same time
    to say "number_box." Those instances are now unstyled.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Check that the holds count on catalogue/detail.pl is styled
    3) Check that the patron modifications count on members/member.pl is styled
    4) Check that the pending comments count on tools/tools-home.pl is styled
    5) Check that the pending tags count on tools/tools-home.pl is styled

    Bug 17545 [Revised] Make "Add biblio" not hidden by language chooser
    
    This alternate patch changes the menu direction so that it "drops" up
    instead of down. This avoids the problem of overlapping or being hidden
    by the language chooser.
    
    The disadvantage of this patch is that it is not global. However, I
    think it's a better long-term solution to the problem.
    
    To test, apply the patch and follow the issue description:
    
    - Make sure more than one language is active for the staff client, so
      that the language chooser bar shows at the bottom of each page
    - Do one or more Z39.50 searches, to make sure you have some records in
      the reservoir
    - Go to "Cataloging" and do a "Catalog search", so that the reservoir is
      searched. Make sure your search is broad enough that some results from
      the reservoir is shown "below the fold"
    - Scroll to the last result and click on the "Actions" menu
    
    The direction of the menu should be up instead of down.

    Popup menus on the cataloging search page now pop up instead
    of down, which means they avoid being hidden by the language
    chooser. Mission accimplished!

    Bug 12359: Add HidePatronName functionality to the holds queue
    
    This changes the Holds Queue page to not show the patron's name
    and phone number, but only the cardnumber, when HidePatronName
    is set to 'Don't show'
    
    This also changes the link to the patron account to use
    the borrowernumber instead of the cardnumber, which seems
    more consistent.
    
    Fixes a tiny capitalization error: Only item...
    
    To test:
    - Look at the holds queue page with holds displayed
    - Toggle HidePatronName system preference and observe the change
    - Make sure the link works correctly

    Bug 14736 - AllowRenewalIfOtherItemsAvailable slows circulation down in case of a record with many items and many holds
    
    If the AllowRenewalIfOtherItemsAvailable sys pref is set to allow, and a
    borrower has an item checked out that has many items {30+} AND many
    holds {70+) on it, loading the checkouts table for this borrower takes
    FOREVER to load. The load time takes forever, because of the
    factoring that happens to determine if an item is truly
    available for renewal.
    
    This patch swaps the use of GetMemberDetails for GetMember
    and reorders the subroutine calls to check each items' renewability
    from fastest to slowest.
    
    In a test case, the results of pre patch were:
    Start of loop: 2016-08-24T11:05:14
    End of loop:   2016-08-24T11:05:29
    Resulting in 15 seconds being spent in the loop
    
    Post patch results were:
    Start of loop: 2016-08-24T11:08:43
    End of loop:   2016-08-24T11:08:48
    Resulting in only 5 seconds being spent in the loop!
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Note there are no changes in functionality for the renewals column of
       the patron checkouts table.
    
    If you wish to go further and test the performance benefit:
    1) Create a record with 50 items and 100 holds ( 50 waiting, 50 unfilled )
    2) Check out one of the waiting holds to a patron
    3) Time the amount of time it takes for the checkouts table to load
    4) Apply this patch
    5) Repeat step 3, you should see an improvement in load time

    Bug 17377: ES - Take control fields into account
    
    There is a bug in Koha::SearchEngine::Elasticsearc::Search->json2marc, it
    assumes that the MARC::Field constructor always takes >= 5 parameters.
    This assumption is wrong for control fields, to create a control field you
    need to call the constructor with:
      MARC::Field->new($tag, $value);
    
    Note that I got "Too much data for control field" in the _warning value of my
    MARC::Field because too many parameters were passed, and the value was undef.
    
    That broke the result search links (on the staff interface) for DB with
    biblio.biblionumber mapped with 001.
    
    Other bugs will certainly be fixed by this patch.
    For instance I got:
      GetMarcBiblio called with undefined biblionumber at /home/koha/src/opac/opac-search.pl line 664.
      GetCOinSBiblio called with undefined record at /home/koha/src/opac/opac-search.pl line 665.
    in my logs, with this patch I don't get them anymore.
    
    Test plan:
    You can try to recreate the different issues and confirm than this patch
    fixes them.
    Or just run the tests

    Bug 17522: Fix opac-user.pl if OpacRenewalAllowed is set
    
    This patch fixes a bug added by commit 81a04af27804621609004dc370284413baa5caa2
        Bug 14610 - Add and update scripts
    
    If OpacRenewalAllowed is enabled, the following error message is
    displayed:
    
    Template process failed: undef error - The method is_expired is not
    covered by tests! at /home/vagrant/kohaclone/C4/Templates.pm line 121.
    
    The is_expired and BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions methods did not exist
    for the Koha::Patron object. These 2 values were returned by
    GetMemberDetails.
    
    To fix this, we need bug 17579 which introduces the
    Koha::Patron->is_expired method and also bug 17604 for the
    Koha::Patron->effective_BlockExpiredPatronOpacActions.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Check out an item for a patron
    2) Enable OpacRenewalAllowed
    3) Log in as that patron, go to opac-user.pl
    4) Note the error
    5) Apply this patch
    6) Reload opac-user.pl
    7) Page should now load!

    Bug 17579: Make sure we are testing the real life
    
    Without this patch, the tests are not testing the same things as what
    happens on the interface.
    We need to refresh the object to make sure the date set into dateexpiry
    is the one in DB.
    Without this patch, ->is_expired test a datetime object, with this patch
    it compares with a date oject
    
    Without the changes made in Koha::Patron->is_expired, a patron which has
    a dateexpiry set to today was marked as expired on the interface. This
    is a change in the behavior, what this refactoring does not want to do.

    Bug 17420 - record export fails when itemtype on biblio
    
    In Tools, Export data, you can export with a filter on item type.
    When item type is on biblio record, you get the error :
    export.pl: DBIx::Class::ResultSet::next(): Unknown column 'biblioitems.itemtype' in 'where clause' at /home/koha/src/Koha/Objects.pm line 150
    
    Looks like its because this code use to be a SQL Select and is now a DBIx call :
                              C4::Context->preference('item-level_itypes')
                                ? ( 'items.itype' => $itemtype )
                                : ( 'me.itemtype' => $itemtype )
    
    This patch corrects by using "me.itemtype"
    
    Test plan :
    - Use syspref item-level_itypes = biblio record
    - Go to Tools > Export data : /cgi-bin/koha/tools/export.pl
    - Select an item type
    - Click on "Export biblio records"
    => Without patch you get an error 500
    => With patch you get a correct export file

    I find these tests too much complicated and decided to remove them.
    They depends on the number of fields in the DB and any time we change
    this table we need to update the tests.
    As I don't understand the tests, I prefer to simply remove them, they
    don't seem very useful.
    Feel free to provide a counter patch if you think we should keep them.

    Bug 17394 - exporting checkouts with items selects without items in combo-box
    
    In checkouts table, the is an export form (when some exports syspref are enabled).
    When selecting some checkouts and selecting "ISO2709 with items" in export format combo-box, clicking on "Export" will select "ISO2709 without items" in the export format combo-box.
    This is quite strange.
    Its because the form as 2 inputs with same name and id "output_format" : an hidden input (the wanted arg for tools/export.pl) and a select (the export format combo-box).
    So an action meant on the hidden input impacts the select.
    
    This patch corrects by changing id and name of the export format combo-box : issues-table-output-format
    
    TEST plan :
    - Enable checkouts exports by setting syspref ExportWithCsvProfile with a profile
    - Go to circ page of a patron with checkouts : /cgi-bin/koha/circ/circulation.pl?borrowernumber=xxx
    - Show checkouts table
    - Select some checkboxes in "Export" column
    - Select "ISO2709 with items" in export format combo-box
    - Click on "Export"
    => Without patch, the export format combo-box changes to "ISO2709 without items"
    => With patch, the export format combo-box does not changes
    - Check the export file contains the items
    - Check exports "ISO2709 without items" and "CSV" are OK

    Bug 16493: acq matching on title and author
    
    When you order from a staged file you're getting duplicate warnings that
    are inaccurate.  For example, when you order a file of 50 DVDs for
    example and they don't have ISBNs they're matching on the books. And
    then you have to order them one by one.
    
    This patch replaces the use of FindDuplicates with Koha's match point
    system. This means you can select from the same match points defined
    and used in the batch record importer, or you can opt to skip matching
    altogether!
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Import a record with a title, isbn and author.
    2) Delete the from the record and stage it again
    3) Attempt to add it to a basket via the staged record
    4) You should note the gives you the "No records imported" message
    5) Apply this patch
    6) Create a matcher for ISBN
    7) Create a matcher for Author/Title
    8) Attempt to add the record to your basket using the ISBN matcher
    8) Koha should find no match and import the record to the basket
    9) Stage the record again
    10) Attempt to add the record to your basket using the Title/Author matcher
    11) You should recieve the "No records imported" message.

    Bug 17537: Fix valid-templates.t for some include files
    
    3 include files do not pass the template validation tests:
     - koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/includes/admin-items-search-field-form.inc
     - koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/includes/subscriptions-search.inc
     - koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/includes/opac-topissues.inc
    
    This is because they process a block which has not been declared before.
    As they are include files, they cannot stand on their own.
    We could have added them to the exclude file list of xt/author/valid-templates.t
    but I think it's better to keep them into the validation loop.
    
    Test plan:
      prove xt/author/valid-templates.t
    should return green
    And the library dropdown list should be correctly populated on the pages these files are included
    (opac-topissues for instance)

    Bug 17504: Make the installer show the right dmbs help if wrong permissions
    
    This patch changes the installer template for step 2 (DB rights check)
    so it correctly displays MySQL-related message.
    The previous code was doing the wrong comparisson, thus yielding
    PostgreSQL documentation.
    
    To test:
    - Run:
      $ sudo koha-mysql kohadev
      > DROP DATABASE koha_kohadev ; CREATE DATABASE koha_kohadev;
      > REVOKE INSERT ON koha_kohadev.* FROM 'koha_kohadev'@'localhost';
      > FLUSH PRIVILEGES; \q
    - Run the webinstaller through step 2
    => FAIL: You get the message in the attached screenshot
    - Apply the patch, reload
    => SUCCESS: You are displayed a different warning message, with a link
    to up-to-date MySQL docs on GRANT
    - Fix permissions for the user:
      $ sudo koha-mysql kohadev
      > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on koha_kohadev.* TO 'koha_kohadev'@'localhost';
      > FLUSH PRIVILEGES; \q

    => SUCCESS: All checks are correct and you can move on

    Bug 17274: Display the place where the memcached is picked
    
    The memcached config can be read from ENV or koha-conf.xml
    In order to remove any ambiguity, let's inform the user which config is
    used.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Define the memcached config in ENV and $KOHA_CONF
    => Go on about page, you should get a warning
    2/ Define the memcached config in ENV and not in $KOHA_CONF
    => Go on about page, you should get a warning
    3/ Do not defined the memcached config in ENV or $KOHA_CONF
    => Go on about page, you should get a warning
    4/ Define the memcached config in $KOHA_CONF and not in ENV
    => Go on about page, you should not get a warning, this is the expected
    config

    To test:
    - Apply this patch, have memcached configured for the current instance (this is the
      default in kohadevbox)
    - Make sure you have the memcached server running:
      $ sudo service memcached start
    - Open the about page in the browser
    => SUCCESS: You get something like:
      Memcached:    Servers: 127.0.0.1:11211 | Namespace: koha_kohadev | Status: running
    - Stop the memcached server:
      $ sudo service memcached stop
    - Reload the about page
    => SUCCESS: You get something like
      Memcached:    Servers: 127.0.0.1:11211 | Namespace: koha_kohadev | Status: not running
    - Set both MEMCACHED_* variables in the apache config for intranet the empty string:
      $ sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/kohadev.conf
    ..
       SetEnv MEMCACHED_SERVERS ""
        #"127.0.0.1:11211"
       SetEnv MEMCACHED_NAMESPACE ""

    Bug 15581: Display the latest auto renew date possible when renewing manually
    
    If an issue marked as auto_renew is renewed manually, we want to display
    the latest auto renew date possible.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Define circ rules as in the previous patch.
    2/ Check a item out, mark it as an auto renewal
    3/ Back date the issuedate and make sure it will be too late to renew it
    4/ Use the Circulation > renew page (circ/renew.pl) to manually renew
    this issue.
    You should get a warning "You barcode has been scheduled for automatic renewal
    and cannot be renewed anymore since DATE."
    If the pref AllowRenewalLimitOverride is set, you will be allowed to
    renew it anyway.

    Bug 15581: Add a circ rule to limit the auto renewals given a delay
    
    This patch adds a new circulation rule (no_auto_renewal_after) to block/allow
    auto renewals after a given delay.
    For instance, if the issue date is 10 days before today, and
    no_auto_renewal_after is set to 10, tomorrow the issue won't be auto
    renewed.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Execute the update DB entry
    Note: You will have to manually change data in your DB, make sure you
    have access to the sql cli.
    1/ Define a rule with no_auto_renewal_after (10 for instance) and
    norenewalbefore (5 for instance).
    (This new rule will behave the same as norenewalbefore: the unit depends
    on the lengthunit value).
    The automatic renewals will be done from 5 to 10 days ahead.
    2/ Modify the issues.issuedate, to simulate a checkout in the past:
        UPDATE issues
        SET issuedate = "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
        WHERE itemnumber = YOUR_ITEMNUMBER;
    with issuedate = 2 days before for instance
    3/ Execute the automatic renewals cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/automatic_renewals.pl)
    Confirm that the issue has not been renewed (too soon)
    4/ Repeat step 2 with a due date set as 11 days before
    5/ Execute the automatic renewals cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/automatic_renewals.pl)
    Confirm that the issue has not been renewed (too late)
    6/ Repeat step 2 with a due date set as 7 days before
    7/ Execute the automatic renewals cronjob script (misc/cronjobs/automatic_renewals.pl)
    Confirm that the issue has been renewed (issues.renewals has been
    incremented and date_due has been updated according your circ rules).

    Bug 15803: Koha::AuthorisedValues - Remove C4::Koha::GetAuthorisedValueCategories
    
    The subroutine C4::Koha::GetAuthorisedValueCategories just retrieves all
    the authorised value categories.
    We already have a method in the Koha::AuthorisedValues module to do this
    job, let's use it!
    
    Technical explanations:
    The new subroutine of the AuthorisedValues TT plugin will allow to get
    the authorised value categories from the templates.
    The new html_helpers include file will get rid of the if selected else
    end statements. Bug 15758 already uses this file, see the commit
    description for more informations.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Create or edit a new fund (aqbudgets.pl), the fields "statistic 1"
    and "statistic 2" should be correctly filled with the list of authorised
    value categories
    2/ Edit subfields for a biblio and authority framework.
    The "Authorized value" dropdown list should be correctly filled on both
    pages
    3/ Create new items search fields (from the administration area), same
    as previously, the authorised value category dropdown list should be
    correctly filled
    4/ Add and edit patron attribute types, check the authorised value
    category list.

    Bug 7039 - Link to existing record from result list in acquisition search
    
    In the Staff client -> Acquisitions, when creating orders from
    existing records the result list should link to the existing
    records so that it's possible to check for existing items.
    
    This patch adds that functionality.
    
    Test plan:
    1) In the Staff client, go to Acquisitions and try to add an order
       from existing records.
    2) Observe that the titles in the Summary column are not hyperlinks.
    3) Apply the patch.
    4) Repeat step 1), and confirm that the titles are now links
       pointing to each biblio's details page.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 17356: [QA Follow-up] Minor changes to skeleton.perl
    
    Due to the way the snippet is run, there is no need to add a use for
    C4::Installer or define $dbh (just like $DBVersion).
    The suggested code is commented (column_exists is not defined).
    Just as in updatedatabase, CheckVersion is called. The version number
    does not need to contain 16.06; if we do so, we should update this
    number each release. The XXX's work just fine.

    Bug 17428: [REST] best practice followup
    
    This followup alters a few area's to be aligned more closely with
    RESTfull best practices:
    
    * PUT should always be full objects, and not partial updates (use PATCH
      for partials)
    * Validate query parameters instead of blindly passing them to the model
      * Functional Change: Convert filter params from 'equality' to 'starts with'
        matching
    * Update tests to check for swagger validation errors instead of koha exceptions
    * Mark 'id' as readOnly so swagger may prevent, via validation, id
      changes.

    - Apply the patches
    - Update your minified swagger file:
      $ cd kohaclone/
      $ misc/devel/minifySwagger.pl -s api/v1/swagger/swagger.json \
                                    -d api/v1/swagger/swagger.min.json
    - Run:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/api/v1/cities.t
    => SUCCESS: Tests should return green, and no warnings.

    Bug 13321: Fix the prices calculation method
    
    Well, we have finally arrived here \o/
    
    The method where the prices are calculated uses the equations listed on
    the wiki page (http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/GST_Rewrite_RFC).
    
    The ecost is calculated from the rrp (using the discount and the tax
    rate). That's why we removed the ability to edit this value.
    
    That's why we remove the ability to edit the ecost on ordering in a
    previous commit (bug 12840).
    
    The total is now calculated in the scripts. That's why this patch
    removes lines in the test file.
    
    In C4::Acquisition::populate_order_with_prices, the calculation on
    receiving must depend on the 'invoiceincgst' supplier parameter, and not
    listincgst (which is used on ordering).
    It also removes the rounding errors, now we store "exact" values in DB
    (10^-6).
    The values will be displayed using the Price TT plugin it will round the
    values for us.

    Bug 13321: Rename variables
    
    This patch renames the variable according to the new DB column names
     * gste => tax_excluded
     * gsti => tax_included
     * gstrate => tax_rate
     * gstvalue => tax_value
    
    This patch also modify the ModReceiveOrder subroutine:
     * Edit vendor note on receiving is not possible, so the code should not
       permit that.
     * Update ModReceiveOrder to pass a hashref
    
    And that's all!
    git grep on gste, gsti, gstrate and gstvalue should not return any code
    that can be executed.

    Bug 15801: Koha::BiblioFrameworks - Remove C4::Koha::getframeworkinfo
    
    This was the "Get" subroutine for the framework, it can be easily
    replaced with a call to the Koha::BiblioFrameworks->find method.
    This patch also replaces some confusing wordings (framework vs frameworkcode).
    
    Test plan:
    On the circulation home page, you should see a "Fast cataloguing" link
    if the FA framework exists.
    
    Note that the admin/marctagstructure.pl has already been tested in the
    previous patch.

    Bug 15801: Koha::BiblioFrameworks - Remove C4::Koha::getframeworks
    
    C4::Koha::getframeworks returned a hashref of biblio frameworks.
    It was mainly used to generate the dropdown list of frameworks.
    The scripts modified in this patch did not necessary order the element
    by description (frameworktext), the displays were not consistent from
    one screen to another.
    Using the same search method everywhere:
      Koha::BiblioFrameworks->search({}, { order_by => ['frameworktext'] });
    We will know always get the framework in the same order.
    
    Test plan:
    Following the different pages modified by this patch, and make sure the
    frameworks are displayed correctly in the dropdown list:
    1/ acqui/z3950_search.pl - Create an order from an external source.
    2/ admin/fieldmapping.pl - Define some mappings keyword / MARC field
    3/ admin/marctagstructure.pl - On the MARC frameworks admin page, select
    another framework than the default one and click on the 'Search' button
    4/ catalogue/MARCdetail.pl - On the MARC defail page, change the
    framework you want to use to display the record
    5/ cataloguing/addbiblio.pl - Add or edit a biblio record, change its
    framework. When editing, the framework of the record should be selected
    by default
    6/ cataloguing/addbooks.pl - Go on the cataloguing home page and click
    on the "New record" button. You should see all the frameworks
    7/ cataloguing/merge.pl - Select 2 biblio records to merge. On the first
    step (select the merge reference), you should be allowed to select the
    framework to use.
    8/ tools/inventory.pl - On the inventory page, the "Item statuses" part
    should be populated as before this patch
    9/ tools/manage-marc-import.pl - Stage records for import. Before
    importing them into the catalog, you should see the framework dropdown
    list.

    Bug 15801: Koha::BiblioFrameworks - Remove C4::Koha::GetFrameworksLoop
    
    The C4::Koha::GetFrameworksLoop retrieves biblio frameworks and returns
    them ordered by the description (frameworktext). If a parameter is
    passed, a selected flag is set. The selection of the options should be
    done on the template side.
    These 2 calls can be replaced with
      Koha::BiblioFrameworks->search({}, { order_by => ['frameworktext'] });
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Go on a Labeled MARC biblio view (catalogue/labeledMARCdetail.pl)
    You should see a dropdown list with the biblio frameworks. The framework
    of the record should be selected by default
    2/ Create a sql report using the biblio_framework parameter, something
    like:
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biblio WHERE frameworkcode=<<framework|biblio_framework>>
    Save and execute the report.
    You should get a dropdown list with the framework list.

    Bug 14629 - [QA Followup] Pass invalid ISSN through GetVariationsOfISSN
    
    This is an optional follow up depending on community opinion.
    
    While copying over the code form the ISBN portion I noticed that with
    aggressive matching enabled invalid ISBNs (and hence ISSNs) were being
    stripped from the record.
    
    I think in the case of a library exporting records, making changes, and
    reimporting they would expect to get a match on ISSN or ISBN whether or
    not the number is valid.
    
    This patch changes the subroutine to return the original ISSN in the
    case of it being invalid.
    
    To test:
    With first patch only export a record with an invalid ISSN and reimport
    with AggressiveMatchOnISSN enabled and match on ISSN - you should not get a match
    Apply this patch
    reimport the file and you should find a match.

    Bug 14629 - Add aggressive ISSN matching feature equivalent to the aggressive ISBN matcher
    
    This patch adds a syspref "AggressiveMatchOnISSN" allowing for a match
    of ISSNs with or without hyphens. It uses Business::ISSN in order to
    follow the use of Business::ISBN and allow for validation of ISSNs
    
    To test:
    1 - Find a record in your system with an ISSN (or add one)
    2 - Stage a record containing the same ISSN but lacking a hyphen
    3 - Matching on ISSN should find 0 matches
    4 - Repeat with no hyphen ISSN in system and hyphen ISSN in import
    5 - Matching should find 0
    6 - Apply patch
    7 - Update datbase and install Business::ISSN
    8 - Leave AggressiveMatchOnISSN as don't and repeat original tests- no
    change
    9 - Set AggressiveMatchOnISSN as do and repeat original test
    10 - You should find a match
    11 - prove t/Koha.t - all tests pass

    Bug 7679: Display all table headers (case and accent sensitive)
    
    It appears that we can't assume that a lowercase word is equivalent to
    the same word in uppercase (or a mix of lowercase and uppercase
    letters). And this is also true about accented words.
    So display all values even if they differ only by case or by their
    accents.
    This means that:
    - "foobar" and "Foobar" will be in two separate rows/columns
    - "Etudiant" and "√âtudiant" (french) will be in two separate
      rows/columns too

    Bug 7679: Various fixes for circulation statistics wizard
    
    - use SQL TRIM functions to avoid having '' and ' ' considered as
      different values
    - use Text::Unaccent to remove accents from columns or rows values when
      accessing %table. This is required as MySQL consider as equals two
      strings that differ only by their accents when using GROUP BY clause.
    - Exclude '' values from the list of columns or rows. Otherwise we could
      have a row 'UNKNOWN VALUE' and a row 'NULL' which both have the same
      values in their cells.

    Bug 5260 - Add option to send an order by e-mail to the acquisition module
    
    With this patch it will be possible to send order information
    to the vendor by e-mail. For now this feature can be triggered
    manually with a button before closing the basket.
    The order e-mail is based on the acquisition claim feature, but
    uses a new notice template.
    
    Test plan:
    
    1) Vendors
    A new checkbox "Contact when ordering?" was added to the vendor
    page.
    - Add a vendor and/or edit an existing vendor
    - Verify the new option is saved correctly
    - Verify the new option displays on the vendor summary page
      after saving
    
    2) Notices
    The feature works with a new notice template: ACQORDER
    It works with the same formatting/fields etc. as the acq claim
    notice.
    - Add a new notice template ACQORDER in module
      'Claim/order aquisition'
    - Make sure to use fields from the various offered tables
      in your notice
    - Verify it is saved correctly
    
    3) Basket
    - Turn on LetterLog system preference
    - Create multiple order lines
    - Click the 'Send order' button in the toolbar
    - Verify error or success message
    - Verify you received the e-mail
    - Verify there is a new entry with about the sent
      notice in your action_logs table
    
    4) Regression testing...
    - Verify order claims still work
    - Verify serial claims still work
    - Verify new serial issue notices still work
    ...
    (I can provide additional test plans if needed)

    Bug 6934: QA Follow-up
    
    Tried to address every single thing that QA mentioned :
    1)Removed isNull function
    2)Changed datepicker properly
    3)We have to fill in two dates not to be flooded with old entries if we don't want to.
    4)The first two fieldsets are now in one bigger field set
    5)Removed the use of $fullreportname variable
    6)Removed the use of dt_from_string when it already recieved a DT.
    7)Removed comments starting with "###" in cash_register_stats.pl
    8)Used Text::CSV::Encoded to generate the CSV file (used guided_reports.pl as an example)
    9)I am not sure if using C4::Reports::Guided is the right choice here. I instead used the same column names as the one recieved by the query in cash_register_stats because this report uses columns from 5 different tables in addition of using both firstname and surname twice.
    
    For the ninth point, I would like to know more about C4::Reports::Guided if you still think using it would be a better solution. Thank you!

    Bug 17435: Gives ability to display stocknumber in search results
    
    Adds stocknumber to data provided for xslt transformation
    
    Test plan :
    1) go to Administration module, MARC default frameworks and add, if not already done, a stocknumber subfield (a priori under the 995 tag). It will be linked to items.stocknumber in the koha.link zone of Advanced constraints section.
    2) edit an item in staff interface and add a number in the stocknumber field.
    3) Edit the xslt opac Results file that you are using and customize it. For a basic test, you can just replace "itemcallnumber" occurrences by "stocknumber".
    4) make a search in a way to get several results including the title from which you modified an item.
    5) You will see the added stocknumber displayed (between square brackets in the default xslt).
    
    Same can be done through staff interface and staff xslt files.

    changing the container around news items from <p> to <div> (because news
    items might contain <p> and nesting them is incorrect).

    Bug 16935 - launch export_records.pl with deleted_barcodes param fails
    
    When launching misc/export_records.pl with this command line :
    
     misc/export_records.pl --date=`date +%d/%m/%Y` --deleted_barcodes --filename=/tmp/koha.mrc
    
    You get this error message :
    
    DBD::mysql::db selectall_arrayref failed: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near '' at line 4 [for Statement " (

            "] at misc/export_records.pl line 189.
    
    This is because of a '(' after 'q|', looks like a typo.
    Also, this patch removes useless var $q.
    
    Test plan :
    - Delete an item with barcode
    - Without patch, run : misc/export_records.pl --date=`date +%d/%m/%Y` --deleted_barcodes --filename=/tmp/koha.mrc
    => You get dirty MySQL
    - Without patch, run the same command

    Bug 14598: (QA followup) use deleted{items|biblioitems} during upgrade
    
    If the 'statistics' table contains circulation information about items
    that are no longer on the DB it will raise a warning. This patch
    makes the updatedatabase.pl script use the deleteditems and deletedbiblioitems
    tables to get information for those items on the statistics table.
    
    To reproduce:
    - Have your sample DB contain some circulation data on the statistics table
    - Make sure some of them have NULL itemtype:
    > UPDATE statistics SET itemtype = NULL WHERE type='return';
    - Check the upgrade query catches them:
    > SELECT s.itemnumber, i.itype, b.itemtype FROM  ( SELECT DISTINCT itemnumber    FROM statistics    WHERE ( type = "return" OR type = "localuse" ) AND itemtype IS NULL ) s  LEFT JOIN  ( SELECT itemnumber,biblionumber, itype      FROM items    UNION    SELECT itemnumber,biblionumber, itype      FROM deleteditems ) i  ON (s.itemnumber=i.itemnumber)  LEFT JOIN  ( SELECT biblionumber, itemtype      FROM biblioitems    UNION    SELECT biblionumber, itemtype      FROM deletedbiblioitems ) b  ON (i.biblionumber=b.biblionumber);

    Note: It is possible that on production sites, if the sysadmin is cleaning the

    as they need to know some data lacks information.

    Bug 14598: (DB update) fix NULL itemtypes in statistics on 'return' rows
    
    This patch introduces an updatedatabase.pl entry that takes care of
    updating existing statistics rows.
    
    It does so by looping on the statistics rows, collecting itemnumber occurences
    that are have NULL itemtypes.
    It then chooses the right itemtype following what is proposed on bug 14651, and
    then updates the rows in statistics using the calculated itemtype.

    Bug 14598: Make C4::Circulation::AddReturn store the right itemtype
    
    This patch makes C4::Circulation::AddReturn correctly store the itemtype
    on the 'statistics' table.
    
    To reproduce:
    - Checkout master.
    - Make a checkout.
    - Check the 'statistics' table and notice the itemtype is correctly set
      > SELECT * FROM statistics;
    - Check the item in.
    - Check the 'statistics' table and notice the itemtype is not set
      > SELECT * FROM statistics WHERE type="return";
    => FAIL: itemtype is set to NULL
    
    To test:
    - Apply the regression tests patch
    - Run the tests:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/Circulation/Returns.t
    => FAIL: Tests fail
    - Apply this patch
    - Run the regression tests:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/Circulation/Returns.t
    => SUCCESS: Tests now pass.
    - Repeat the 'To reproduce' steps
    => SUCCESS: itemtype is now correctly set (in real life)
    - Happily sign off :-D

    Bug 14598: (regression tests) AddReturn should store itemtype on 'statistics' table
    
    This patch adds tests for C4::Circulation::AddReturn(). Both tests are wrapped
    inside a subtest, and look for AddReturn storing the right itemtype on the
    'statistics' table.
    
    Note: It also refactors the file a bit, to avoid side effects. And uses TestBuilder
    to make it independent on already-present db data. It also removes warnings by mocking
    C4::Context::userenv
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patch
    - Run the tests:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/Circulation/Returns.t
    => FAIL: Tests fail bacause AddReturn is not storing the itemtype

    Bug 17376 - rebuild_zebra.pl in daemon mode no database access kills the process
    
    When running rebuild_zebra.pl in daemon mode, a while loop runs the script for ever.
    But if something crashes inside the rebuild process, the all daemon crashes.
    For example when it can not access database.
    This problem may be temporary so daemon should keep running.
    
    This patch add eval around the rebuild process to allow a run to fail without killing the daemon.
    Also moves the DB handler get inside daemon loop because it is broken is DB stoppes.
    
    This is a big issue for indexer running in a systemd service.
    
    Test plan :
    - run rebuild_zebra.pl in daemon mode :
    /home/koha/src/misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -daemon -z -a -b -x --sleep 30
    - stop the database
    - wait a minute
    => you see an error on database connexion
    => the daemon is still running
    - restart the database
    - test the indexer by creating a new record (wait for a minute)

    Bug 17495: Fix 'method selected not covered by test' in reports/issues_stats.pl
    
    If you access reports/issues_stats.pl, you will get
    Template process failed: undef error - The method selected is not
    covered by tests! at /home/vagrant/kohaclone/C4/Templates.pm line 121
    http://localhost:8081/cgi-bin/koha/reports/reports-home.pl
    
    Bug 15407 sent objects to the template and the selected method is not
    defined.
    The bug had been highlighted by bug 17425 which dies instead of hides the error.
    
    Not that the "selected" code was not needed, the different elements of
    the page never select a specific value.
    
    Test plan:
    Apply this patch and confirm that the error is no longuer displayed.
    
    Reproduced. Followed test plan, works as expected.

    - Go to Home > Patron
    - Expand patron search (click on + at the left of the search button)
    - In drop down 'Search fields', select 'Date of birth'
    - Enter a valid date (e.g. 11.02.1995 if syspref 'dateformat' is set to dmydot)
    Result: Search works OK
    - Enter an invalid date, e.g. 11.02 or abcd...
    Result: Internal server error
    
    - Do a patron search with many results
    - Use filter on results screen, select 'Date of birth' as search field and
      enter an invalid date to search (e.g. 'a')

    common in academic libraries where researchers may request a copy of a
    single article found in a journal.
    
    This patch set adds the ability to place article requests in Koha. It
    allows the control of what can be requested via the circulation rules.
    Since article requests of electronic resources are not outside the realm
    of possibility, the feature will check not only the items for
    requstability, but the record itself as well ( i.e. both items.itype and
    biblio.itemtype ).
    
    Article requests can be placed for patrons from the opac and staff
    intranet and can be viewed in most areas where holds are viewed ( e.g.
    patron details, record details, etc ).
    
    There is a script to view article requests in progress within the
    circulation module. Article requests can be Open ( i.e. new ), In
    Processing, Completed, or Canceled. The status of a given request can be
    updated from this script.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply the patch set
    2) Run updatedatabase.pl
    3) Enable the system preference ArticleRequests
    4) Set up some required fields in:
        ArticleRequestsMandatoryFields
        ArticleRequestsMandatoryFieldsItemsOnly
        ArticleRequestsMandatoryFieldsRecordOnly
    5) Edit your circ rules, set article requests to 'yes' for something
    6) Test the ability to add an article request from the opac ( required fields enforced )
    7) Test the ability to add an article request from the staff interface ( required fields no enforced )
    8) Note you can choose item level or record level requests
    9) Change the rule to "record only"
    10) Repeat 6 and 7
    11) Note you cannot choose items
    12) Change the rule to "item only"
    13) Repeat 6 and 7
    14) Note you must choose an item
    15) Note that the 'new request' message is queued for each new request
    16) Browse to /cgi-bin/koha/circ/article-requests.pl
    17) Note requests are split by pickup branch
    18) Test slip printing via the "Print slip" action
    19) Process request vai "Process request" action
    20) Note an email notice is queued for patron
    21) Refresh /cgi-bin/koha/circ/article-requests.pl
    22) Note request has moved to "processing" tab.
    23) Complete request with "Complete request" action
    24) Note message is queued for patron
    25) Cancel a request, add cancelation note.
    26) Note message is queued for patron

    Bug 5670: Housebound Readers Module
    
    New module to handle management of circulation to Housebound readers.
    
    - Ability to create housebound profiles & scheduled visits for patrons.
    - Ability to record users as Deliverers or Choosers (or both), using
      extended patron attributes.
    - Ability to link choosers and deliverers to individual delivery runs.
    - 'Delivery Frequencies' are customizable through authorised
      values ('HSBND_FREQ').
    
    * koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/includes/circ-menu.inc: add
      Housebound menu if appropriate.
    * Koha/Patron.pm (housebound_profile): New method.

      methods.
    * Koha/Patron/HouseboundProfile.pm: New File.

    * t/db_dependent/Patron/Borrower_HouseboundProfiles.t: New file.
    * t/db_dependent/Patron/Borrower_HouseboundVisits.t: New file.
    
    Test plan:
    - Apply patch.
    - Run atomic update script.
    - Run Unit Tests (t/db_dependent/Patron/Housebound*)
    - Optionally, add additional authorised values to 'HSBND_FREQ'.
    - Switch on 'HouseboundModule' syspref.
    - Ensure 'ExtendedPatronAttributes syspref is on.
    - On patron pages, when editing, add some to the Housebound deliverer
      and chooser groups.
    - On a patron page, the Housebound menu should now be present.
      - create housebound profile
        + ensure Frequency values seem pulled from 'HSBND_FREQ'.
      - create 'housebound visits' (deliveries)
        + ensure chooser/deliverer lists are populated with patrons that
          have the Chooser or Deliverer Attribute type.
      - edit visits.
      - delete visits.
    - Switch off 'HouseboundModule'
      - the Housebound menu should disappear

    Bug 17425: Make Koha::Object raise exceptions
    
    This patch makes Koha::Object raise exceptions in the following
    situations:
    - When a non existent accessor is called
    - When a non existent property is tried to be updated using ->set
    
    On implementing this change, we introduce Koha::Exceptions::Object class
    to contain all Koha::Object-specific exception definitions.
    
    Unit tests for this change are introduced in
    t/db_dependent/Koha/Objects.t
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patches on master
    - Run:
      $ prove t/db_dependent/Koha/Objects.t
    => SUCCESS: Tests return green
    - Sign off
    
    Note: A followup introduces the dependency for Try::Tiny. It needs to be
    present for running the tests.

    Bug 17080: Handle default values for NOT NULL columns from Koha::Object->new
    
    Recently we face the same issue on different modules after we moved them to the
    Koha namespace using Koha::Object of using DBIx::Class directly.
    
    1/ Koha::Patron::Modification on bug 16960 comment 14 and 15
    2/ Koha::Patron::Category from bug 17069
    3/ C4::Members::AddMember (which does not use Koha::Object) on bug 16917
    
    If a DB column is defined as NOT NULL and has a default value, the DBIx::Class
    $rs->update_or_insert method won't use the default value if the column name
    has been passed to the constructor.
    
    We do that almost everywhere as we retrieve the data from the HTML forms without
    checking/cleaning them.
    
    There are several ways to fix that:
    1/ Continue to fix them case by case (what we did for the recent issues)
    2/ Try to fix them globally (existing ones and the next ones)
    
    This patch propose a global solution to avoid future issues of this kind.
    
    The idea is not to pass the undefined values which cannot be nullable to the
    DBIx::Class constructor.
    
    Tested all patches together. Works as expected.

    In many cases it should be possible to derive the Koha::Objects class
    name from the DBIx result class name in a trivial manner.
    If not, the DBIx result class should have a class method called
    koha_objects_class providing that non-trivial name, such as Libraries
    for Branch.
    
    Note: We are only interested in the plural form here (Koha::Objects).

    Bug 16965: search_related returns an instanciated Koha::Objects-based object
    
    Koha::Objects->search_related should return a Koha::Objects-based
    object.
    This search_related method should follow the same rules as the search
    method, i.e. take into account what the caller want (scalar or list).
    The problem here is that we do not know (in Koha::Objects) what is the
    kind of objects we want to instanciate. To know it, this patch adds a
    get_object_class, it will return the class of the object and the
    resultset Koha::Object-based object.
    
    The drawback of this method is that we will have to keep it up-to-date
    every time we add a new Koha::Object class.

    2/ Delete patrons using the web interface:

     - Batch patron deletion tools
    3/ and the cronjob script
     - perl misc/cronjobs/delete_patrons.pl -c [more options]
    
    The patron should have been moved to the deletedborrowers table, his/her
    holds and lists should have been deleted.

    order to replace it with the Koha::Patron->move_to_deleted method.
    Next after this change, we will move C4::Members::HandleDelBorrower and
    C4::Members::DelMember to the same module to simplify the code in
    members/deletemem.pl and misc/cronjobs/delete_patrons.pl
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Delete a patron from the staff interface and make sure (s)he has been moved to
    the deletedborrowers table.
    2/ Use the "Batch patron deletion" tool (tools/cleanborrowers.pl) to
    remove patron. Make sure the "Permanently delete these patrons" and "Move
    these patrons to the trash" options work as before
    3/ Same as previously but using the cronjob
    misc/cronjobs/delete_patrons.pl.

    Tested the delete_patrons.pl script and cleanborrowers.pl too.
    Tests (are relevant and) pass and the qa scripts are happy too :-D

    Bug 17318: Allow chosing fixed normalization routines
    
    This patch changes the matching-rules.pl page, so it allows the user to choose
    from the different hardcoded normalization routines. It is done using TT blocks
    and the routine descriptions are translatable.
    
    To test:
    - Create some matching rule
    - Have free text values on the 'Normalization rule' field
    - Apply the patches
    - Create a new routine
    => SUCCESS: You can now only choose between fixed option
    - Save the rule
    - Open it for editing
    => SUCCESS: Chosen rules are preserved
    - Edit the original free-text including rule
    => SUCCESS: Rules fall back to 'None'
    - Sign off :-D
    
    TODO: A followup will add a warning about the current value and the fact that
          saving the matching rule will overwrite those, with 'none'.

    Bug 17318: Make C4::Matcher::_get_match_keys handle 'norms' param
    
    The current implementation doesn't care about that parameter, and applies
    a default normalization rule that seems counter-productive (in general) for
    its aleged purpose.
    
    This patch makes it handle the following values for 'norms':
    
        - upper_case
        - lower_case
        - remove_spaces
        - legacy_default
        - none
    
    They make it call the relevant Koha::Utils::Normalize routines. 'legacy_default'
    is used only for backwards compatibility, but could be removed if there's consensus.
    
    To test:
    - Run:
      $ prove t/Matcher.t
    => FAIL: most _get_match_keys tests fail
    - Apply the patch
    - Run:
      $ prove t/Matcher.t
    => SUCCESS: Tests pass!

    Bug 17318: Unit tests
    
    The current C4::Matcher::_get_match_keys implementation doesn't take
    normalization rules params into account. This patch makes Matcher.t test the
    proposed behaviour for new hardcoded values, that match string normalization
    routines introduced by Bu 17302.
    
    Possible values are:
    - upper_case
    - lower_case
    - remove_spaces
    - legacy_default
    - none
    
    * 'legacy_default' is left (for now) to catch the current behaviour. So tests which
    did not get a 'norm' param, now are passed 'legacy_default' and they still pass.
    
    * 'none' means no normalization, of course
    
    Note: on introducing 'none', a bug got highlighted, because the subfields traversal loop
    was introducing an unneeded space. The tests from 17304 get adjusted to reflect this.
    
    To test:
    - Run:
      $ sudo koha-shell kohadev ; cd kohaclone
      $ prove t/Matcher.t
    => FAIL: The routine doesn't care about the norms param.

    Bug 17252 - Koha::AuthorisedValues - Remove GetAuthorisedValueByCode
    
    The subroutine C4::Koha::GetAuthorisedValueByCode returned the
    description (staff or opac) for a given authorised value.
    
    Note that we may need a unique key to ->find instead of ->search.
    
    Test plan:
    - Checkin an item that cannot be checked in because it's lost, the
      message should display the AV description
    - Generate a letter with borrowers.streettype equals an ROADTYPE AV, the
      description should be displayed.
    - Edit a patron attribute type, the AV dropdown list should be
      displayed
    - Create the PA_CLASS AV category (see bug 7154) and make sure it
      behaves as before when editing a patron
    - The checkout list should display descriptions for LOC, LOST and
      DAMAGED

    Bug 17251: Koha::AuthorisedValues - Remove GetKohaAuthorisedValuesMapping
    
    This subroutine was only used once in GetItemsForInventory.
    It can be replaced with a quite simple search on AV join on
    authorised_value_categories and marc_subfield_structures tables.
    
    Note that the "interface" parameter was always set to "staff" and was
    useless.
    
    Test plan:
    Play with the inventory and confirm that the AV descriptions are
    correctly displayed.
    
    The tests in t/db_dependent/Items/GetItemsForInventory.t cover this
    change and should still pass.

    Bug 17250 - Koha::AuthorisedValues - Remove GetAuthValCode
    
    The subroutine C4::Koha::GetAuthValCode returned the authorised value
    category for a given kohafield.
    This can be acchieve easily using a new Koha::AuthorisedValues->search_by_koha_field
    method which will mimic search_by_marc_field.
    
    Test plan:
    Confirm that the description is correctly displayed on the following
    pages:
    - detail and moredetail of a bibliographic page (itemlost, damaged, materials)
    - Set AcqCreateItem=ordering and receiving items.
    The description for notforloan, restricted, location, ccode, etc.
    field should be displayed.
    - Items search form
    - On the checkout list from the circulation.pl and returns.pl
    pages, the description for "materials" should be displayed
    
    Note that GetKohaAuthorisedValuesMapping is going to be removed on bug
    17251.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 16245: [QA Follow-up] Replace typeofrecord2 by biblevel
    
    Position 7 of the leader is better referred to as biblevel.
    (Pos 6 is record type.)

    It seems that bib level in the UNIMARC leader only allows a subset of
    the possible combinations for MARC21. This does not have bad side-effects
    however in the new code that tests bib level to determine the type tag.

    Bug 16245: RIS export file type incorrect
    
    When exporting lists to a RIS file, the TY field of the RIS file is always
    'book' even if the item being exported is a journal or serial.
    Since unimarc and marc21 is coded in Koha, just a few references types are
    included. This needs a much better code.
    
    This bug changes only TY BOOK result. Other resources needs a case by case
    basis.
    
    To test:
    -In advanced search limit by itemtype (books, music, continue resources, etc).
    -Search and save result in Cart
    -Export to RIS Format and notice about the new TY change with all materials
    -Export record in bib record details page in OPAC and Intranet.
    -Confirm that works as expected.
    -Bonus test:
    -Try to import the  RIS file in  http://www.myendnoteweb.com if you
    have account or create one.
    NOTE: According with previous comment, some values has changed.

    Bug 17368: Update KitchenSinkPlugin.kpz
    
    The KitchenSinkPlugin plugin is used is t/db_dependent/plugins.t to test
    if our system plugin is ok.
    Currently this plugin is broken because it uses subroutines which have
    been removed: GetBranchesLoop and GetBorrowercategoryList
    
    A PR has just been made
    (https://github.com/bywatersolutions/koha-plugin-kitchen-sink/pull/2)
    This kpz has been generated on top of the following commit:
    
      commit 5d109c9e1a5d3d314b346a529f2059176778d05a
        Adapt code for versions > 16.06.00.018
        2 subroutines has been removed and the plugin does not work
        anymore.
    
    with:
    % zip -r KitchenSinkPlugin.kpz Koha

    Recently added, delete_records_via_leader.pl reads biblioitems.marc as a
    text field and search for record to delete regarding the leader 5.
    This can be acchieve doing the same thing on biblioitems.marcxml (will
    certainly be slower) waiting for a patch on bug 15537.
    
    Test plan:
    Confirm that this script works as before, to do so the easiest way would
    be to dump your DB before executing the update DB entry, execute the
    script to delete records, reinsert the DB, execute the udpate DB entry
    (remove biblioitems.marc), execute the script to delete records.
    You should get the same number of records deleted.

    Bug 17405 Edit record uses Default framework
    
    In detail view (catalogue/detail.pl), when clicking on Edit > Edit
    record button, the record editor should be opened with the biblio record
    framework. It isn't the case. The Default framework is used. Same issue
    with Edit > Edit as new (duplicate).
    
    TO TEST:
    
    1. Find a biblio record using a framework which is not the Default one.
    2. See the biblio record in detail view (catalogue/detail.pl).
    3. Click on Edit > Edit record.
    4. Click on Settings => you can see 'Default' as selected framework.
    5. Apply the patch.
    6. Repeat step 3-4. => the biblio record framework is selected.
    7. Repeat 3-4 using Edit > Edit as new (duplicate).

    If you fill the patron self reg with non-latin characters, they will be

    Test plan:
    0/ Do not apply the patch

    2/ fill surname, fistname with something like "Micha≈Ç pou√©√†√ß"
    3/ Save
    4/ See the bad encoding/replacement on the screen and look at the data
    The accentued chars are replaced with their html representation and the
    non-Latin chars with a 'x'
    in the DB
    5/ Apply this patch
    6/ Repeat steps 2, 3
    7/ Everything should be ok
    8/ Try to make sure this HTML::Entities escape was not useful:
    fill surname with "surname <script>alert("xss?")</script>"
    Save and look at the data

    Bug 17367 - Showing all items must keep show holdings tab in OPAC details
    
    In OPAC details page, when record as too many items (depending on syspref OpacMaxItemsToDisplay), they are not displayed in holdings tab.
    You can click on link "Click here to view them all" to show them : page reloads with a new arg viewallitems=1.
    Also you can choose which tab is shown by default using syspref opacSerialDefaultTab.
    
    The bug is that when default tab is not holdings, clicking on link to show all items will show another tab. So one must reclick on holings tab to see all items.
    
    This patch corrects by forcing holdings tab when arg viewallitems is defined.
    
    Test plan :
    - Create a serial record with more items than syspref OpacMaxItemsToDisplay (or decrease this syspref)
    - Select "Subscriptions tab" for syspref opacSerialDefaultTab
    - Go to opac details on this record : /cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=xxx
    => You see Subscriptions tab selected
    - Click on Holdings tab
    => You see no items but a link "Click here to view them all"
    - Click on this link
    => Without patch you see Subscriptions tab selected
    => Wih patch you see Holdings tab selected and the items

    Bug 17423 - patronimage.pl permission is too restrictive
    
    Bug 14566 added the permission "borrowers" on patronimage.pl.
    This perm is too restrictive because circulation pages also uses this page.
    
    I propose to simply use "catalogue" perm.
    
    Test plan
    - Set an image to borrower xx
    - Create a user with only catalogue permission
    - Log with this user
    - Go to page (replace xx by borrower number) : /cgi-bin/koha/members/patronimage.pl?borrowernumber=xx
    => Without patch you get the page saying you do not have the permission

    Bug 14514 - LocalHoldsPriority and the HoldsQueue conflict with each other
    
    It appears that the LocalHoldsPriority feature and the Holds Queue are
    fundamentally at odds with each other.
    
    The problem appears to be that both are attempting to choose the best
    way to fill holds. When you are using the holds queue and you check in
    an item that has been selected by the holds queue builder, that part of
    Koha where the LocalHoldsPriority feature lives doesn't get to see all
    the holds in order to pick the best one. Instead only the hold selected
    by the holds queue builder is returned so to the LocalHoldsPriority
    feature, that is only one hold to pick from!
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) prove t/db_dependent/HoldsQueue.t
    3) All tests should pass

    Bug 17248 - Koha::AuthorisedValues - Remove GetKohaAuthorisedValueLib
    
    The subroutine C4::Koha::GetKohaAuthorisedValueLib just retrieves a description
    (lib) for a given authorised value.
    
    We can easily replace it using:
      Koha::AuthorisedValues->search({ category => $cat, authorised_value => $av })->lib
    or
      Koha::AuthorisedValues->search({ category => $cat, authorised_value => $av })->opac_description
    
    Test plan:
    - On the detail page of a bibliographic record, the description for notforloan,
    restricted and stack (?) should be correctly displayed
    - View a shelf, the location (LOC) description should be displayed
    - On the search result page, the location description should be displayed in the
      facets
    - Set AcqCreateItem=ordering and receiving items.
    The description for notforloan, restricted, location, ccode, etc. field
    should be displayed.
    - When creating item in the acquisition module, the dropdown list for
      field linked to AV should display the AV' descriptions
    - On the transfers page, the description of the location should be
      displayed.
    - On the checkout list from the circulation.pl and returns.pl pages, the
      description for "materials" should be displayed
    - Fill some OPAC_SUG AV and create a suggestion, the reason dropdown
      list should display the description of OPAC_SUG

    Bug 17216: Add new table authorised_value_categories and populate it
    
    This patch set adds a new table authorised_value_categories to store
    authori(s|z)ed value categories into a separate table.
    The problematic is explained on bug 15799 comment 4:
    We need FK to the AV categories but some may not have authorized values
    yet.
    
    What does this patch set:
    - Add a new authorised_value_categories table
    - Populate it with known categories
    - Update FK items_search_fields.authorised_values_category
    - Create a new FK marc_subfield_structure.authorised_value (FIXME should
      be authorised_value_categories instead)
    
    They are some problems this patch set do not take into account:
    - The .sql installer files won't insert correctly (will have to be
      updated when this patch set will be ready to be pushed)
    - All the categories (even the ones without authorized values defined)
      are listed when you edit frameworks (marc_subfield_structure.pl)
    - There is no way to delete a category (TODO). But to do so it would be
      good to have a authorised_value_categories.is_internal field to mark
      some categories as "cannot be deleted".
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Execute the DB entry to create and populate the new table and set the FK
    1/ Create a new AV category from the admin module (admin/authorised_values.pl)
    2/ Add/edit subfield linked to a AV category
    (admin/marc_subfield_structure.pl)
    3/ You won't be allowed to add AV for branches, itemtypes or cn_source.
    They are used internally.

    Bug 17432: Remove minification
    
    The swagger specification file is currently being minified adding
    manual steps to release management and restful api route development.
    The minification is not required; The deferenced version of the
    specification is now internally validated at runtime and relavant errors
    output and the dereferenced schema has been made publically available at
    /api/v1/spec, so it can be copy&pasted into validation tools
    
    Test Plan
    1) Apply patch
    2) Ensure api routes still function (applying the /cities patch might be
        helpful)
    3) Ensure /api/v1/spec page exists (it should be the de-referenced
        swagger.json file)

    Bug 14899: Add the mapping configuration page in the admin module
    
    This new page (admin/searchengine/elasticsearch/mappings.pl) will permit
    to manage the ES mappings.
    For the biblios and authorities indexes, the different mappings can be
    managed from this single page.
    The interface let you add, remove and update mappings and search fields.
    It's also possible to reorder the mappings, as the order can be important
    in the indexation process. Note that the table can be displayed in a
    different order that the one it was before saving, but the mappings are grouped
    by search field and the order inside the search field is preserved.
    
    Limitations:
    - If something went wrong during the insertion/deletion/modification,
      the users will loose all these changes.
    
    TODO:
    - Add a specific permission (?)
    - Add some data checks client side (JS)
    - Use checkboxes for facet and suggestible (lazy today...)
    - Understand the difference between the 3 values that sortable can have
      and improve the value for the options in the select box.

    Bug 17091: Add AUTOLOAD to Koha::Objects
    
    Up to now if a Koha::Objects based object needs to call DBIx::Class methods, we
    have to create a new method for Koha::Objects, something like:
      sub method {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self->_resultset->method
      }
    
    To simplify and ease the call to DBIx::Class method, this patch defines an
    AUTOLOAD to call the DBIx::Class method on the resultset we are encapsulating.

    Create a new install and confirm that the ES tables (search_field,
    search_marc_map and search_marc_to_field) are correctly populated.
    
    Bonus points: Use an older DB (prior to 3.23.00.050), execute the
    updatedatabase.pl script and confirm that the ES table are correctly
    populated

    Bug 17403: Internal Server Error while deleting patron
    
    This patch fixes a Internal Server Error while deleting patrons.
    
    To reproduce:
    
    - Go to a patron's detail page
    - Toolbar : More : Delete
    - Confirm "Are you sure you want to delete..."
    
    Result: Internal Server Error
    Plack error log:
    exited nonzero: 1 at /home/marc/koha/members/deletemem.pl
    Note: Patron is deleted
    
    Additional tests: Try to delete yourself, to delete a staff member
    without having superlibrarian permission etc.
    
    To test:
    
    - Apply patch
    - Re-start plack
    - Try to reproduce steps above (with other patron)
    Expected result:
    No Internal Server Error, Redirect to Home > Patrons
    
    Amended to include all occurences of 'exit 1'

    Bug 16769: [QA Follow-up] Remove unsupported deepcopy parameter
    
    Routine C4/Koha/GetAuthorisedValues adds deepcopy => 1 to the options of
    set_in_cache. This makes no sense (anymore?). Is not supported or passed
    further. So better remove it.
    
    Test plan:
    Run t/db_dependent/Koha.t (with Test::Deep available to minimize confusion)

    Bug 17310: Broken URLs in 'Item renewed' / 'Cannot renew' messages
    
    In the Staff client, under Circulation > Renew, the message shown after
    successful renewal of an item contains broken URLs. This is also true for
    the message shown when you try to renew an item that is not checked out.
    
    This patch fixes that.
    
    Test plan:
    1) Go to Circulation > Renew, and search for the barcode of a checked-out
       item. In the 'Item renewed:' confirmation message, notice how the URLs
       for the title and the barcode are broken.
    2) Now search for the barcode of an item that is not checked out. In the
       'Cannot renew:' message, notice how the URLs are broken here too.
    3) Apply the patch.
    4) Repeat steps 1) and 2). This time the URLs work fine.

    Bug 17088: [Follow-up] Use Logger for failed exports
    
    Fixes a TODO for logging unsupported record_type in _get_record_for_export.
    Also logs a warning when the record_type parameter is not supplied at all in sub export.
    Replaces a warn by a log message about an invalid record for format iso2709.
    Also adds a log message about an invalid record for format xml.
    Adds a trivial unit test for passing no record_type to export.
    
    Test plan:
    See also first patch.
    Run t/db_dependent/Exporter/Record.t.

    Bug 17088 - Bad MARC XML can halt export_records.pl
    
    If export_records.pl encounters a record that fails to load correctly as
    a MARC::Record the export process will fail and only the records
    encountered up to that point will be exported.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Pick a record in your database, and replace the biblioitems.marcxml field with some random characters
    2) Export your records using the command:
       misc/export_records.pl  --format xml --record-type bibs --filename /tmp/biblios.xml
    3) Note you get an error and the script ends prematurely
    4) Apply this patch
    5) Repeat step 2
    6) Note the full record set is exported ( except for your bad record )
    7) Note an error is still generated for your bad record ( useful for
        tracking down bad records ).

    Bug 17292 - Use of DBIx in updatedatabase.pl broke upgrade
    
    A recent change in the 'subscription' table structure highlighted a
    problem in a DBRev upgrade (3.23.00.006). As it adds a new column, when
    upgrading from (say) 3.20.00.000 the code/schema (correctly) expects the
    subscription.itemtype column to exist. But it is not created until DBRev
    16.06.00.025.
    
    To reproduce:
    - Have a clean 3.20.00 DB loaded into kohadevbox
    - Checkout current master
    - Run:
      $ perl installer/data/mysql/updatedatabase.pl
      => FAIL: The upgrade procedure fails due to missing colum.
    
      The solution: rewrite the updatedatabase.pl entry using plain DBI

    Bug 17352 - Patron search type is hard coded to 'contain' in circ/circulation.pl
    
    The patron search type is hard coded to 'contain' in
    circ/circulation.pl.
    
    This causes problems because a mis-scanned cardnumber can bring up the
    wrong patron.
    
    The example that our partner gave us involved scanning '1733', which
    doesn't match any borrowers when we do a 'start_with' search, but
    matches the cardnumber 'p291733'.
    
    If we follow the usage in members/member.pl, we can set searchtype in
    HTTP params, which is amenable to fixes in intranetuserjs
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Use the checkout search, not changes should be noted
    
    Extra credit:
    1) Add javascript to intranetuserjs to add a hidden input named
    'searchtype' with the value 'start_with'
    2) Checkout searches should now give only results where a searched
       field starts with the given string(s)

    Bug 16273: Add the ability not to display the login details for newly registered patrons
    
    When a new patron registers, the confirmation page is displayed with
    login details (login, password, cardnumber) and the login form is
    prefilled.
    In the case of public computer, for security reasons that should not
    appear, patrons might forget to close the window.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Set PatronSelfRegistrationPrefillForm on
    2/ Register a new patron
    => The login details should not be displayed and the login form should
    not be prefilled.

    Bug 17083: Remove more event attributes from tools templates
    
    This patch removes event attributes from several tool-related templates.
    Events are defined instead in the JavaScript.
    
    To test, apply the patch and:
    
    - Go to Tools -> Label creator -> Manage -> Layouts and edit any layout.
      - In the "Font" setting, choose any font which includes the word
        "italic" or "oblique" in the name. Doing so should disable the
        "Oblique title" checkbox.
    - Go to Tools -> Batch patron deletion/anonymization.
      - Submit the form without making any changes. You should be prompted
        to select an action.
    - Go to Tools -> Inventory.
      - Select a batch of barcodes to upload.
      - Submit the form without selecting any filters. This should trigger a
        warning.
      - Also changed: Added Font Awesome icons to the "Select all" and
        "Clear all" links on the inventory results view.
    - Go to Tools -> Notices and Slips.
      - Click "New notice"
      - Change the selection under "Koha module." The page should reload
        with the correct available message body fields. For instance,
        selecting "Holds" should make available reserves.* columns.
    - Go to Tools -> Upload.
      - In the search form, enter a search term and click the 'Search'
        button. The form should submit.

    Bug 17056 - Remove event attributes from various templates
    
    This patch removes event attributes from several templates, moving event
    definitions into the JavaScript instead.
    
    To test, apply the patch and:
    
    - View the MARC detail page for any bibliographic record. Changing the
      framework selection should reload the display using the selected
      framework.
    
    - Perform the same test on the labeled MARC view. (Set the
      viewLabeledMARC system preference to "Allow" if necessary).
    
    - To test the changes to Reports you should have at least one report
      group and at least one report subgroup.
      - Create a new saved SQL report.
      - Select a report group. Doing so should trigger the display of report
        subgroups. Deselecting the report group should hide the subgroups.
    
    - In Acquisitions -> Suggestions, create a new suggestion.
      - In the 'Acquisition information' section, changing values for
        copies, currency, and price should change the value in the total
        field.
    
    - In Circulation -> Upload offline circulation file:
      - My patch for Bug 16602 added the required code but forgot to remove
        the corresponding onclick attributes.
      - Browse for an offline circulation file.
      - Clicking the 'Upload file' button should work correctly.
        - After uploading a file, both the 'Add to offline circulation
          queue' and 'Apply directly' buttons should work to trigger their
          corresponding processes (keeping Bug 16603 in mind).

    Bug 16552: Add the ability to change the default holdings sort
    
    This new enhancement will add the ability to change the default holdings
    sort on OPAC displays to be by library, instead of item type.
    
    This patch adds a new pref OPACHoldingsDefaultSortField with 3 different
    possible values:
     - Item type
     - Home library
     - Holding library
    
    Note that if OpacLocationBranchToDisplay is set not to display home libraries,
    unexpected behaviors might happen if OPACHoldingsDefaultSortField is set to
    "Home library", same for "Holding library".
    
    Test plan:
    - Confirm that the default value for OPACHoldingsDefaultSortField is
      'first column' after executing the DB entry and that there is no
      change in the behavior (first column is used to sort the holdings
      table on the detail page).
    - Set OpacLocationBranchToDisplay to both and play with the different
      values of OPACHoldingsDefaultSortField
      => Confrm that the default column used to sort the table is correctly
      changed
    - Set the pref SeparateHoldings on
      => Confirm that both tables (Holdings and other holdings) are sorted using
      the OPACHoldingsDefaultSortField value.

    This new enhancement will allow to add the name of lists containing a

       koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/css/opac.css
    1/ Create some lists and add items to them
    2/ On the search results you should see the name of the lists which
    contains the record.
    
    Note that we could add a syspref to make this new behavior optional.

    Bug 16519: Replace 'our' with 'my' in [opac-]addbybiblionumbers.pl
    
    To avoid bug like bug 16518 and to ease the readability/maintainability

    avoid the use of global variables.
    
    Basically the code has been moved from subroutines to the appropriate places.
    
    Test plan:
    At the intranet and OPAC sides
    1/ Add items to a list
    2/ Add items to a list using an existing name
    3/ Add items to a list you don't have right on it (by modifying the
    biblionumber in the url)
    4/ At the OPAC, use the opac-addbybiblionumber.pl without being logged
    in to add items to a list

    Bug 14435: Add the ability to store result's report
    
    At one time it was possible to store the results of a report into the
    saved_reports table.
    This allowed the librarians to compare different results, from the Koha
    interface.
    
    This patch is a proof of concept and is not very polished (understood:
    it cannot be pushed like that).
    
    Test plan:
    Execute the runreport.pl cronjob script with the new --store-results
    option.
    This will serialize into json the results and put it into the
    saved_reports table.
    
    On the "Saved report" list, the "Saved results" column is now populated
    with a date (note that you can have several date for a given report).
    If you click on this link, the data will be displayed in a simple table.

    Bug 9896 - Show vendor in subscription search when creating an order for a subscription
    
    In the staff client, when creating an order from a subscription
    the vendor name should be shown in a separate column.
    
    This patch adds that feature. The 'Vendor' column is added before
    the 'Library' column since they appear in that order in Advanced
    search.
    
    Test plan:
    0) [PREREQUISITES] In the Staff client, under Acquisitions, create
       a Vendor and associated Basket if you don't already have them.
       Then, under Serials, add a new Subscription using the Vendor
       you've just created.
    1) Go to Acquisitions, and under 'Manage orders' search for a vendor,
       then click on 'Add to basket' and select 'From a subscription'.
    2) Click 'Search' on the left hand side to search for all subscriptions.
       Notice how there is no 'Vendor' column in the results table.
    3) Apply the patch.
    4) Repeat step 2. Confirm that the patch works, i.e. there is now
       a 'Vendor' column which displays the vendor name.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 17312 - Typo in members-toolbar.inc / moremember-brief.tt / moremember.tt
    
    The following three templates are using [% guarantorborrowernumber %]
    while they should be using [% guarantor.borrowernumber %]:
    
    members/members-toolbar.inc
    members/moremember-brief.tt
    members/moremember.tt
    
    This doesn't result in any breakage; just a couple of 'Edit' links that
    do not pass the guarantorid in the URL, and one case where guarantor
    information is not shown in the staff client.
    
    This patch fixes that.
    
    Test plan:
    0) [PREREQUISITE] Create a patron with a guarantor if you don't have one.
    1) Go to Home > Patrons and search for a patron that has a guarantor. In
       the Details page for that patron, the 'Edit' link in the toolbar does
       not pass the guarantor's id in the URL (...&guarantorid=&...).
    2) In the same page, the 'Edit' link under the patrons name (immediately
       under 'Guarantor') again does not include the guarantor id in the URL.
    3) Go to Home > Patrons and click on 'New patron'. Pick any category from
       the drop down menu. Enter the Surname, First name, and Date of birth
       of the patron you used in step 1). This triggers the 'Duplicate patron
       record?' warning -- click on 'View existing record' and notice how the
       guarantor information is missing.
    4) Apply the patch.
    5) Repeat steps 1), 2), and 3) above. The URLs are fixed and patron info
       is showing.

    Bug 10768 - Improve the interface related to itemBarcodeFallbackSearch
    
    When the itemBarcodeFallbackSearch syspref is on, the wording in the
    interface should reflect that you can enter a barcode OR a keyword.
    Additionally, in the results of a keyword search the "Fast cataloging"
    link should be more descriptive. This patch fixes these issues.
    
    Test plan:
    
    0) [PREREQUISITES] Ensure you have a Fast Add ('FA') framework defined,
       and that your itemBarcodeFallbackSearch syspref is set to 'Enable'.
    1) Go to Circulation -> Check out, search for a patron, then select a
       patron to Check out. Notice how the text above the textbox reads
       "Enter item barcode:".
    2) Type something generic (not a barcode) in the textbox so that you'll
       get at least one item as a result. Notice how the text in the yellow
       warning box reads "The barcode was not found: <terms> Fast cataloging".
    3) Apply the patch.
    4) Repeat step 1), now the text above the textbox should read
       "Enter item barcode or keyword:".
    5) Repeat step 2), now the text in the yellow warning box should read
       "The barcode was not found: <terms> Add record using fast cataloging".

    Bug 17315: (Bug 17210 follow-up) Fix "Save to lists" links from the result page
    
    On bug 17210, the selector .addtoshelf should not have caught the
    .addtoshelf nodes from the result list.
    To fix this, we just need to make the selector more specific (and cannot
    reuse it without more changes, the biblionumber variable is not the same
    - vs SEARCH_RESULT.biblionumber).

       new patron attribute type and you get the following Software error:

    Bug 17327: Item level holds no longer enforced
    
    Reported by Katrin:
    
    Example:
    - on shelf holds allowed
    - holds allowed 5
    - holds on same record allowed 5
    - FORCE item level holds
    
    On a record with only one item, you can only place a record level hold
    in OPAC now - which is against your circulation conditions.
    
    Another example:
    - record with 2 items
    - circulation rules as above, 1 hold allowed on the record
    - Item level holds: forced
    
    I can only place record level holds in OPAC and staff. At the moment, I
    am not able to place item level holds in any circumstances in my
    installation.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply the unit test patch
    2) prove t/db_dependent/Reserves/MultiplePerRecord.t
       should fail
    3) Apply the second patch
    4) prove t/db_dependent/Reserves/MultiplePerRecord.t
       should pass

    Bug 17135: [QA Follow-up] Change location of new script to fix fines
    
    The location of the script in misc/maintenance would be fine for
    running it from the command line. But it will be a problem for several
    install types when running it from the web installer.
    Files from misc/maintenance go to bin/maintenance in a package install,
    not to mention other installs than a dev install.
    
    This patch moves the script to installer/data/mysql. Already there are two
    other scripts run by upgradedatabase. I would rather move these three
    scripts somewhere else, but we c/should do that on another report.

    Bug 16752 - Remove the use of event attributes from some acquisitions templates - Transfer order
    
    This patch removes the use of 'onclick' from the acquisitions transfer
    order process. The patch also modifies the style of some links and
    buttons to conform with current guidelines.
    
    - Locate an open basket with items in it
    - Click the 'Transfer' link for a title in the basket
    - In the pop-up window:
      - Confirm that the 'Cancel' button at the bottom of the window is a
        Bootstrap-style button.
      - Search for a vendor; Confirm that the 'Choose' link is a
        Bootstrap-style button.
      - Choose a vendor; Confirm that the 'Choose' link on the following
        page is a Bootstrap-style button.
      - Confirm that clicking the 'Choose' button transfers the item to the
        correct basket.

    Bug 16752 - Remove the use of event attributes from some acquisitions templates - Funds
    
    This patch modifies the funds administration page and other files
    related to the process of searching for and selecting fund owners and
    users in order to remove the use of event attributes like 'onclick.'
    
    Also changed in this patch: I have revised the way the "select owner"
    and "select user" controls look. They are now links with Font Awesome
    icons.
    
    - Go to Administration -> Funds and open a fund for editing.
    - Test the process of adding and updating an owner:
      - Click the 'Select owner' link.
      - Search for and select an owner in the pop-up window.
      - Save the fund and verify that the owner was saved correctly.
      - Perform the same test with the 'Remove owner' link.
    - Use the same process to test the addition and removal of users.
      - Confirm that the 'Remove' link works correctly before and after
        submitting the form to save changes to the fund.
    
    This patch changes a file which is used by both the funds template and
    the template used when setting a guarantor on a patron. To test the
    changes in that context:
    
    - Open a 'child' type patron record.
    - Under 'Guarantor information,' test the process of setting and
      removing a guarantor to confirm that data is saved correctly.

    Bug 13134 - Add patron category to returns confirmation dialogs
    
    Some librarians find it useful to know what category a patron is before
    confirming a reserve or transfer from the checkin screen.
    
    This patch adds the patron category to the hold and transfer popups
    to the patron information already displayed. The li tags that contain
    the patron category have the class "patron-category" to allow this data
    to be easily hidden.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Trap a hold for a patron, note the patron category is now displayed
    3) Trap a hold for pickup at another loation, note the patron category
       is now displayed

    REPLICATE ISSUE:
    
    1. Map biblio.frameworkcode to 999$b
    2. Map biblio.biblionumber to 999$c
    3. Add a record with something in 999$b
    4. 999$b is removed by C4::Biblio::AddBiblio()
    
    After this patch, the field used by biblio.biblionumber or biblioitems.biblioitemnumber
    is not removed and created anew, thus dropping all existing additions.
    
    There is no point in dropping the field in any case, since we can just replace
    the existing subfields in-place with no need to recreate the whole field.

    Bug 17010 - Canceling a hold awaiting pickup no longer alerts librarian about next hold
    
    In previous versions of Koha, if a hold canceled from the "Holds over" tab had other holds on it,
    the librarian would be alerted with the message "This item is on hold for pick-up at your library"
    and directed to check it in to fill the next hold. This no longer happens.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Find a hold that has been waiting too long
    3) Cancel that hold via waitingreserves.pl
    4) Note you get the message "This item is on hold for pick-up at your library"
    5) Confirm the ok button redirects you to the correct tab

    Bug 17299: Display date due correctly on SCO
    
    Unless it's an hourly loan, date due should not display the time part
    (23:59).
    Because of bad code in GetPendingIssues, date_due is replaced with a
    DateTime object and is copied into date_due_sql.
    We need to use this date_due_sql to correctly display the date due in
    the sco module.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Enable WebBasedSelfCheck syspref
    2/ Check out an item to User A -- Do not use an hourly loan.
    3/ Log in to Koha self check ( {OPAC URL}/cgi-bin/koha/sco/sco-main.pl).
    4/ Enter User A's cardnumber.
    Without this patch, checkouts are
       MM/DD/YYYY 12:00 AM (Timeformat: 12 hour)
    or MM/DD/YYYY 00:00    (Timeformat: 24H)
    With this patch applied, only the date is displayed
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 16276: Make the batch patron deletion tool deal with last_seen
    
    This patch adds the same change as the previous one to the batch patron
    deletion tool.
    
    If the pref TrackLastPatronActivity is enabled, the librarians will be
    able to delete patrons who do not have been connected since a given
    time.
    
    Test plan:
    Define a date for the "who have not been connected since" options and
    confirm that it works as expected.

    Bug 16276: Make delete_patrons.pl deal with --last_seen
    
    This patch modify the delete_patrons.pl cronjob to deal with the
    last_seen option.
    
    To test it, you just have to use the --last_seen option and pass a valid
    date (iso format)
    
    Example:
      perl misc/cronjobs/delete_patrons.pl --last_seen="1984-02-04" --confirm
    will delete all the patrons who do not have been active since this date.

    Bug 16276: Update borrowers.lastseen when a patron is active
    
    In order to add the ability to delete patrons who have been inactive for
    more than a given time, we need to track down the last time they were
    active.
    To do that, we need a new DB column in the borrowers table (lastseen).
    Note that the borrowers.lastseen column will not be initialised for existing
    installations (set to NULL) so inactive existing patrons will never be
    deleted.
    A workaround would be to init them at the date when the new column will
    be added.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Set the new pref TrackLastPatronActivity on
    1/ Log in as a patron (staff or OPAC)
    2/ Check that the borrowers.lastseen field has been updated with the
    current time

    Bug 17147 [Revised] Streamline messages following batch record modification
    
    This patch changes the display of informational messages during and
    after the batch record modification process. Instead of showing a
    separate dialog for each record modified, messages are now grouped into
    one dialog.
    
    To test, apply the patch and clear your browser cache if necessary. You
    must have at least one MARC modification template defined.
    
    - Go to Tools -> Batch record modification.
    - Submit a list of biblionumbers which contains at least one number
      which doesn't exist in your database.
    - Confirm that warning and success messages are grouped instead of
      showing in separate dialogs.
    - Submit a list of biblionumbers using a MARC modification template
      which contains no actions. Confirm that the resulting error message is
      correctly formatted.
    
    Revision formats the error messages without the unordered list, which
    was giving them padding which didn't look correct inside a dialog.

    Bug 16949: Batch record deletion says success when no records have been passed in
    
    The reason this happens is because the page will say success when the
    total number of records given equals the total number of successful
    deletions. If you pass in no records, there are no successful deletions
    --> 0 = 0 --> it thinks it has been successful. This patch adds a check
    that validates if any checkboxes were selected before submitting the
    final form.
    
    I have removed the check for if any records were selected AFTER the form
    has been submitted because it seemed unnecessary if the form can't be
    submitted without selection of records anyway.
    
    To test:
    1) Go to Tools -> Batch record deletion
    2) Put in a record number and click Continue
    3) Deselect the record so that it doesn't actually delete and click
       Delete selected records
    4) Page says 'All records have been deleted successfully!'
    5) Apply patch. Go back and repeat step 3
    6) Form should not submit and you should receive an alert saying that no
       records have been selected.
    7) If you try selecting and deleting a record after this alert, it
       should still work
    
    Note: Have also changed the wording of error in Step 1 when you are
    entering record numbers to delete.

    Bug 16732 - Add audio alerts (custom sound notifications) to web based self checkout
    
    This patch adds the infrastructure needed to allow audio alerts, as
    configured in administration, to affect the sco module
    
    This patch allows only for the use of sounds with a full URL to be used
    and does not allow for the Koha standard sounds to be accessed via the
    SCO
    
    To test:
    Ensure you have the preference AudioAlerts enabled
    Ensure you can hear normal sounds from the staff module
    Define an audio alert such as:
        Selector: .sco_entry
        Sound: https://archive.org/download/Doorbell_1/doorbell.ogg
    Load the SCO module
    You should hear the doorbell noise (everytime you reload even!)
    Test that the default sounds are not activated for the SCO, you must
    sepcifically define them

    Bug 10227 : Fix GetMessagingPreferences when digest is possible
    
    This bug is a bit tricky to test, as the result is somehow  random, depending on the order of rows returned by sql request. You've got to change the preferences several times to see bad results.
    
    Enable EnhancedMessaging preferences
    Set preferences for a borrower or a category.
    run misc/cronjobs/advance_notices.pl and look in message_queue table the letter_code of the generated messages.
    Change digest selection and do the test again several times
    
    Without patch, for message where digest is allowed (Advance_Notice, Item_Due), for a borrower or a category with 'wants_digest' selected, GetBorrowerMessagingPreferences returns sometimes letter_code with DGST and sometimes not.
    
    With the patch, letter_code returned is always correct depending on digest selected or not

    Bug 7677 [Follow-up]: New areas in subscriptions and new functions when receiving.
    
     - Various fixes.
    
    Test plan:
    
    Once the makePreviousSerialAvailable syspref is enabled, receive a serial, and then another, then check that:
    
     - the first received itemtype has been set to the "previous item type" value (set in the subscription).
    
     - the first received has been made available.
    
     - the last received serial itemtype has been set to the "item type" value (set in the subscription).
    
     - 995$l is automatically prefilled.
    
    Configure the serialsFieldsToAV syspref. When creating or editing a subscription, check that:
    
     - the domain and/or origin and/or support fields are correctly displaying the authorized values configured in the syspref.

    Bug 16311 - Advanced search language limit typo
    
    In the OPAC -> Advanced Search, the Language drop down menu incorrectly
    lists Romanian as "Rom√¢n (Romanian)" while the correct value (as reported
    by Barry Cannon) is "Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian)".
    
    This patch fixes that:
    a) for _new_ installations by modifying
       installer/data/mysql/mandatory/subtag_registry.sql (loaded by the web
       installer when koha is installed), and also
    b) for _existing_ installations by adding an atomicupdate file in
       installer/data/mysql/atomicupdate/
    
    Test plan:
    1) In the OPAC, go to Advanced search (cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl).
    2) In the 'Language' drop down menu, observe that the value for Romanian
       is "Rom√¢n (Romanian)".
    3) Apply the patch, and run installer/data/mysql/updatedatabase.pl.
    4) Refresh the Advanced search page in the OPAC. Confirm that the patch
       worked, i.e. the Language drop down menu lists Romanian as
       "Rom√¢nƒÉ (Romanian)" (notice the added 'ƒÉ').

    The patron details page always show the logged in library as the

    particular to moremember.pl and does not affect other patron pages.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Find a patron with a home library other than the logged in library
    2) Note the patron home library as shown on moremember.pl matches
       the logged in library and not the patron's true home library

    4) Reload moremember.pl, the correct home library should display!

    Bug 17206: Fix switch to default framework
    
    When editing a bibliographic record, if you switch the framework to
    default, the page is reloaded but the framework is not changed.
    From the pl script, you can see that the frameworkcode is set to the one
    of the biblio if set to false. The empty string, which means default,
    should be taken into account.
    
    Test plan:
    - Create a record using the Fast add framework
    - Save the record
    - Open the record for editing
    - Use the "Settings" pull down to change the framework to default
    - Try another framework
    - Try changing to default from there

    Bug 17194 - When edit record, Button "Z39.50/SRU search" not work
    
    Bug 15859 introduced a problem in the basic cataloging editor by
    removing a form field which the Z39.50 search button tries to use when
    triggering the search window pop-up. This patch corrects the error by
    changing where the script looks for the required framework code.
    
    To test, apply the patch and got to cataloging.
    
    - Edit a record which uses the default framework.
      - Confirm that the Z39.50/SRU search button works correctly to trigger
        the pop-up window.
    - Repeat the test with a record which uses a different framework.

    Bug 6852: Staged import reports wrong success for items
    
    If we import items that have a wrong branch code, the items will not
    be imported but manage-marc-import reports them as imported. (A wrong
    branch code probably occurs most, but other causes are possible too.)
    
    The underlying cause is that AddItem does not look at the error
    returned from _koha_new_item in Items.pm.
    
    This patch deals with that omission in the most economical way. It adjusts
    AddItem so that it returns undef if no item was added.
    In ImportBatch.pm I check if an item was added and adjust the totals
    accordingly instead of just always counting them.
    
    Note: Several scripts like additem.pl use AddItemFromMarc to call
    AddItem. They do not report an error, but fail silently. With this patch,
    these scripts get undef and will still fail silently. (No change.)
    Adding error checks around calls of AddItemFromMarc is outside the scope of
    this report. Here we are taking care of correct imported item numbers.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Verify that additem.pl still works by adding a new item.
    [2] Run t/db_dependent/Items.t
    [3] Add a new branchcode, say XXX.
    [4] Pick a biblio record with a few items (n) and set one item to branch XXX.
    [5] Export this biblio with items to a MARC file.
    [6] Change the XXX item to the original branch and remove branch XXX.
    [7] Import the MARC file. Verify that one item was not imported and that
        the number of imported items reflects that (equals n-1).

    Bug 15164 - Allow editing of the invoice number after initial saving
    
    When you notice a typo in your invoice number after finishing with the
    receiving process, the only way to correct it right now is in the
    database - or by undoing all the steps and starting over.
    
    It would be nice if the invoice number could be edited.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Browse to acqui/invoice.pl for an invoice
    3) Note the new "Invoice number" field contains the existing invoice
    4) Alter the invoice number
    5) Save the invoice
    6) Note the invoice number has been updated
    7) Edit the invoice again
    8) Attempt to save the invoice with an empty invoice number field
    9) Note that you cannot save the invoice without having an invoice number

    Bug 17187: Lower the timeout preference from 139 days to 1 day
    
    Default timeout is now 12000000 seconds == almost 139 days !
    Surely, your session will be shorter. But we should lower this
    value.
    Balancing usability and security, I propose 1d (1 day) now.
    Current pref value will be affected only if it is NULL or equal
    to the old default.
    
    Test plan:
    Check your current value. Optionally change to NULL or 12000000.
    Run the dbrev and see what happens.
    Beware of cached values while testing or flush the cache.

    Bug 16978: Followup - Copy create_report permissions for delete_report
    
    This patch should deal with comment #6's point of where a user who
    has create, but not execute permissions, would lose delete ability.
    Users with create and execute permissions would already have delete
    as well.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
     1) Back up db
     2) drop database koha_library;
     3) create database koha_library;
     4) web install with all sample data with system user
     6) log into staff client as system user
     7) make sample koha admin user a superlibrarian
     8) set username and password for sample koha admin user
     9) log out and log in as koha admin
    10) Create a user (USER_A) with permissions:
            create_reports   and execute_reports.
    11) Create a user (USER_B) with permissions:
            create_reports,  but not execute_reports.
    12) Create a user (USER_C) with permissions:
            execute_reports, but not create_reports.
    13) Create a user (USER_D) with no report permissions.
    14) Run the atomic update.
    15) Check USER_A permissions
        -- should have delete_reports
    16) Check USER_B
        -- should have delete_reports
    17) Check USER_C
        -- should NOT have delete_reports
    18) Check USER_D
        -- should NOT have delete_reports
    19) run koha qa test tools
    20) restore db

    Bug 16978: Add delete reports user permission
    
    This splits off the delete capability from the create reports permission.
    From a UI perspective there were CSS issues, that this patch set hackily
    bypasses. Perhaps someone else can amend this enhancement with the required
    changes so that the extra column at the beginning of the table can be
    removed when the user does not have delete capability.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
    1) back up db
    2) apply patch
    3) ./installer/data/mysql/updatedatabase.pl
       -- should run without issue.
    4) in mysql:
       > drop database ...
       > create database ...
       -- totally blanks it for fresh web install
    5) run web install
       -- installing should have no issues
    6) go to a patron
    7) set permissions
    8) expand the reports permission
       -- should have delete reports now
    9) click help and scroll down to
       'Granular Reports Permissions' right at the bottom.
       -- there should be a new delete_reports section
    10) Head over to guided reports and build a few reports.
        -- as system account user, delete stuff should all be visible.
    11) Find a patron, set all permissions, except delete reports.
    12) log out and then log in as the modified patron
    13) Head over the save reports
        -- none of the delete options should be available to the user.
    14) run koha qa test tools
    15) restore db
    
    Followed test plan. Additionally tried to delete using params in URL
    (not possible, OK)

    Bug 16963 - Remove the use of "onclick" from subscription add template
    
    This patch removes the use of event attributes from the subscription add
    template and the template for testing prediction patterns. Events are
    now defined in the JavaScript.

    Bug 16946 [Revised] Remove the use of "onclick" from several serials templates
    
    This patch modifies several serials module templates to remove the use
    of event attributes. Events will now be defined in JavaScript.
    
    Also changed:
    
    - In Serials -> Check expiration, custom form validation has been
      removed in favor of validation with the plugin.
    - In Serials -> Claims, the "Clear filter" button has been replaced with
      a link. Error messages are now styled with the standard "alert" class.
    - In Serials -> New subscription -> Search for record, the "choose" link
      is now a Bootstrap button. Pagination links are now styled like other
      similar links. The "Close" button is now styled as in other popup
      windows. The "no results found" messages is styled as an informational
      dialog.
    - In Serials -> Subscription -> Edit routing list, the "add recipients"
      and "delete all" controls are now links with Font Awesome icons.
    
    To test, apply the patch and:
    
    - Go to Serials -> Check expiration.
      - Try to submit the form without filling in a date. The form
        validation plugin should warn you that the date field is required.
      - Submit the form using data which will return results.
      - Click the "Renew" button for any result. The subscription renewal
        popup should be triggered for the correct title.
    
    - Go to Serials -> Claims.
      - Select a vendor with missing issues.
      - Confirm that the date filter works correctly, and that the "Clear
        filter" link works.
      - Select one or more result and click the "Send notification" button.
        The notification should be sent.
    
    - Go to Serials -> New subscription.
      - Click the "Search for record" link to trigger the bibliographic
        search popup.
      - Perform a search. Confirm that the "Choose" button selects the
        correct record and populates the fields in the parent window.
    
    - Go to Serials -> Subscription -> Edit routing list.
      - Confirm that the process of adding recipients to the list works
        correctly.
      - Confirm that changing the rank of any recipient works correctly.
      - Save the routing list and click the "Save and preview routing slip"
        button on the confirmation page. The slip preview should open.
      - In the slip preview window, test that the print button works
        correctly.

    Bug 17112: Action buttons for course reserves detail page
    
    This patch revises the edit and delete buttons on the course reserves
    detail page so that they are styled as Bootstrap buttons with Font
    Awesome icons.
    
    To test, apply the patch and choose or create a course reserve which has
    in it at least one lost item and at least one item which is checked out.
    
    - In the list of items on the course reserve detail page, confirm that
      the 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons are correctly styled.
    - Confirm that for the checked out item the delete button is disabled.
      Hovering over the button should trigger a tooltip. Clicking the button
      should trigger an alert.
    - Confirm that for the lost item the same is true.

    2) Go back to the authority search and click View full heading for an authority with no records. Notice that under the auth name, it says Number of records used in: 0, with a link to a catalog search
    3) Apply patch
    4) Repeat steps 1 and 2. Authorities not used in any records should no longer have clickable links nd authorities which have records should work as expected.

    Bug 16738 - Improve EDIFACT messages template
    
    This patch makes several improvements to the EDIFACT messages template
    to make it more consistent with similar interfaces in Koha. Changes to
    edimsg.tt are made to simplify the display of the data in a modal.
    
    This patch also corrects a couple of markup errors.
    
    To test you must have multiple rows of data in the edifact_messages
    table. I tested with dummy data I inserted manually. Should should have
    some rows which use 'QUOTE' and 'ORDERS' as the message_type.
    
    To test deletions you may need to apply the patch for Bug 16737.
    
    - Apply the patch and go to Acquisitions -> EDIFACT messages.
    - In the table of messages, the date should be displayed according to
      your system preference.
    - Sorting by date should work correctly regardless of date format
      setting.
    - The 'Actions' column should contain 'View message' and 'Delete'
      Bootstrap-style buttons with Font Awesome icons. The column should be
      unsorted.
    - Clicking the 'Delete' button should prompt you to confirm.
    - Clicking the 'View message' button should trigger a modal which loads
      the message data.
    - Test the page with no messages or when all messages have been
      deleted. The page should display a standard message dialog instead of
      an empty table.

    Bug 16685 - Use eval instead of do for .perl atomicupdates
    
    If we use eval instead of do for our .perl atomic update files, it will
    allow developers to put in the exact code that should go into
    updatedatabase.pl. The problem with do is that none of the variables
    defined in updatadatabase.pl are available, whereas with eval they are.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Create a .perl file in atomicupdates with the following in it:
    say "DBversion: $DBversion";
    3) Run updatadatabase.pl
    4) Note the output
    5) Add a syntax error to your atomic update
    6) Run updatedatabase.pl
    7) Note the error is displayed

    Bug 16586: Koha Plugins: Limit results of GetPlugins by metadata
    
    It would be helpful if we could find a plugin based on some metadata
    tag as returned by the plugin. This extends the use of GetPlugins that
    already supports searching on method.
    
    GetPlugins is used in: admin/edi_accounts.pl, plugins/plugins-home.pl and
    tools/stage-marc-import.pl. The changes in these three scripts are
    minimal and just related to parameter passing.
    
    Test t/db_dependent/Plugins.t includes another test for GetPlugins. In this
    regard a metadata tag has been added to t/Koha/Plugins/Test.pm.
    
    NOTE: This adjustment will also be used in a redesign for bug 15545.
    
    Test plan:
    Run t/db_dependent/Plugins.t.
    Enable pref UseKohaPlugins and config var enable_plugins.
    Go to plugins-home.pl. Verify that it still lists your plugins.
    Bonus: Check edi_accounts or stage-marc-import.pl if you have a working
    plugin for that.

    Bug 16576 [Revised] Remove the use of "onclick" from label templates
    
    This patch updates several label creator templates to remove the use of
    "onclick" in favor of defining click events in JavaScript.
    
    Also changed:
     - Replaced the non-existant element <icon> with <i>
     - Removed the use of <center> and 'align="center"';
     - In the item search results template:
       - The use of the checkboxes jQuery plugin has been replaced with
         straight jQuery for simplicity's sake.
       - Output of table headers has been modified so that translatable
         strings are in the template instead of having English strings
         passed from the script.
       - Moved the 'Add checked' and 'Done' buttons into a floating toolbar.
    
    To test, apply the patch and go to Tools -> Label creator.
    
    - Choose New -> Label batch
      - Click 'Add items'
        - Perform a search for items.
        - Confirm that 'select all' and 'clear all' links work.
        - Confirm that clicking an individual 'Add' button works.
        - Select multiple items and click the 'Add checked' button. Confirm
          that the selected items were added to your batch.
      - Click 'Add items' again to save the selected items to your batch.
      - Test that the 'Delete' and 'Export' buttons next to any item work
        correctly.
    - Choose Manage -> Label batches
      - Test that the 'Delete' button works correctly.
      - Select one or more batches and test that the 'Export selected'
        button works correctly.
    
    Revision: Removed changes to pagination in the item search results
    template since it didn't work.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 16275: Do not allow a self registration with an existing email address
    
    To avoid multiple registrations, it would be good to check the unicity
    of the primary email address.
    This patchset adds a new pref PatronSelfRegistrationEmailMustBeUnique.
    If on, a patron will get "This email address already exists in our
    database" if he try to register with an existing email address.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Register a new patron with an email address
    2/ Make an other registration using the same email address
    => With the pref PatronSelfRegistrationEmailMustBeUnique on, you won't be allowed
    => With the pref off, no change should be noticed.

    Bug 16272: Specific case when switching an on-site checkout to a regular checkout
    
    In the case on-site checkouts are considered as a regular checkout in issuing
    rules (i.e. ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts is on):
    When after the on-site checkout the maximum limit of checkouts is
    reached and the patron wants to switch an on-site checkout to a regular
    checkout, the C4::Circulation::TooMany subroutine will return a
    TOO_MANY_CHECKOUTS error.
    To avoid that, we need to allow an extra checkout in this subroutine.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Switch ConsiderOnSiteCheckoutsAsNormalCheckouts and
    SwitchOnSiteCheckouts on
    1/ In the issuing rules, set the total number of checkouts (maxissueqty)
    to 2 and the number of on-site checkouts to 2 (maxonsiteissueqty)
    2/ Check 2 items out ticking the 'on-site checkout' checkbox
    3/ Check one of these items out, to automatically switch it to a regular
    checkout
    => The checkout should be allowed.

    Bug 16272: Automatically switch an on-site checkout to a regular checkout when checked out
    
    Use case: A patron checks some items out on-site and want to take it home.
    To facilitate the librarian work the checkout is directly switched from
    on-site to regular when checked out if the new pref SwitchOnSiteCheckouts is on.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Let the new pref SwitchOnSiteCheckouts off
    1/ Checkout one items to a patron and tick the "on-site checkout"
    checkbox
    2/ Check the same item out without ticking the "on-site checkout"
    checkbox
    => You should get "This item can not be renewed, it's an on-site checkout"
    3/ Switch the pref on
    4/ Repeat 2
    => The on-site checkout should be automatically switched to a regular checkout

    Bug 16365: Adding additional unsafe call-candidates from Acquisition
    
    [1] Candidate 1 is FillWithDefaultValues.
    This routine in Acquisition.pm does not autovivify the tagslib
    structure but first collects the keys at tag and subfield level.
    So, unsafe can be safely added here :)
    
    [2] Candidate 2 is script acqui/neworderempty.pl.
    It only (!) uses GetMarcStructure to know if there is a ACQ framework.
    There should be cheaper ways to do it, but when we use the fast cache,
    it does not matter that much anymore.
    
    [3] Candidate 3 is script acqui/orderreceive.pl. Same reason as [2].

    Bug 16365 - GetMarcStructure() "unsafe" variant in PrepareItemrecordDisplay()
    
    This sub is a good candidate for the "unsafe" treatment too, it doesn't

    Added a warning in the code regarding the $tagslib usage by the

    Bug 16365: Selectively introduce GetMarcStructure() "unsafe" variant for better performance
    
    GetMarcStructure() currently uses Koha::Cache in the "safe" mode
    (returning deep copy of the result data structure by default), which
    causes numerous performance issues in many Koha scripts. Switching
    it to the "unsafe" mode globally (2nd patch from Bug 16140) resolves
    those issues, but ensuring that it is regression-free (and that it
    will stay that way in the future) is far from easy. This patch
    proposes a bit more manageable solution, it introduces
    a possibility to use "unsafe" variant selectively (only in those
    places in the code where GetMarcStructure() is called repetitively).
    That way, amount of the code that needs to be audited for possible
    problems gets vastly reduced, without any performance trade-offs.
    
    Test plan:
    1) Have a look at the code and audit the parts affected by this patch
    for possible regressions

    Amended the POD of GetMarcStructure, removing a TODO.
    
    NOTE: GetAuthorisedValueDesc, as called in C4::XSLT::transformMARCXML4XSLT
    and by GetISBDView, GetMarcAuthors in C4::Biblio, may autovivify some hash
    entries in tagslib.
    Same for Koha/Filter/MARC/ViewPolicy.pm, sub filter.
    
    No reason however to worry; our use of this structure in Koha does not
    depend on the existence of intermediate hash keys. (We seem to be safe as
    long as $tagslib->{$tag}->{$subfield}->{tab} and/or hidden are not filled.)

    Bug 15839: Koha::Reviews - Remove getreviews
    
    The C4::Reviews::getreviews subroutine retrieved the reviews for a given
    record, depending on their status.
    This can be achieve with a call to Koha::Reviews->search.
    There were 2 calls to this subroutine. The one from opac-ISBDdetail.pl
    does not look in used: the reviews are not display on this page. It
    certainly comes from an old copy/paste from opac-detail.pl.
    The one from opac-detail only asked for the approved reviews. So the
    logged in user does not see its own review if it is pending approval.
    Actually this pending approval review is only displayed when the user
    submits it (because of a unecessary complex text replacement done in
    JS).
    With this patch, the approved reviews AND the unaproved review from the
    logged in user will be displayed.
    It will allow a future enhancement to add a way to delete our own
    reviews.
    
    Moreover, the reviews were retrieved even if they were not displayed (if
    reviewson is off), it's now fixed.

    Bug 15839: Koha::Reviews - Add Koha::Review[s] classes
    
    The subroutines in C4::Reviews are only doing CRUD operations.
    This patch set moves them to 2 new Koha::Review[s] classes.
    
    Test plan for the whole patch set:
    0/ Set the reviewson syspref
    1/ At the OPAC, create a couple of reviews for a record
    Try and create a review without html tags different that br b i em big
    small strong: You should get a warning.
    2/ Edit a review
    3/ On the Staff interface, you should see a "Comments pending approval"
    link on the mainpage
    4/ Approve 1 review and delete the other
    5/ At the OPAC you should only see 1 review (the approved one) in the
    "Comments" tab
    6/ Modify the review
    7/ The review should appear again in the "comments awaiting moderation"
    tab.
    Note that even the comment has not been changed, it will have to be
    reapproved (FIXME later). This behavior already existed prior to this
    patch.

    This patch moves the code from C4::Members::ExtendMemberSubscriptionTo
    to Koha::Patron->extend_subscription.
    
    The expected behavior is:
    When a new patron is created, the enrolment period defined for the
    patron category is used unless an enrolment period date is defined. In
    that case, this date is used.
    When an account is renewed, the pref BorrowerRenewalPeriodBase is used to
    determine if the subscription is renewed from today or from the day when his/her
    account has expired.
    
    Test plan:
    Confirm that the behavior is correct before this patch and that it's
    still the same after this patchset applied.

    Bug 17089: Koha::Ratings - Add Koha::Rating[s] classes
    
    The subroutines in C4::Ratings are only CRUD operations.
    This patch set moves the entire module to Koha::Rating[s] based on
    Koha::Object[s]
    
    Test plan for the whole patch set:
    0/ Set OpacStarRatings to "results and details"
    1/ Log in at the OPAC
    2/ Launch a search, you should see the star ratings
    3/ Go on a detail page, you should see the star ratings
    4/ Rate the record
    5/ Log in with another patron
    6/ Go on the same detail page, you should see the previous rating
    7/ Rate the racord, you should see "2 votes" and the average rating
    value.
    8/ Cancel your rate
    9/ Disable JavaScript and repeat 7
    
    Note: You cannot cancel your rate if JavaScript is disabled (not a
    regression).

    Bug 16822: Make koha-common call koha-plack without --quiet
    
    This patch removes the --quiet option switch in koha-common.init so
    problem information is not hidden for sysadmin users.
    
    To test:
    
    - Have plack enabled for a koha instance:
      $ sudo koha-plack --enable kohadev
      $ sudo koha-plack --start  kohadev
    - Run:
      $ cd kohaclone
      $ debian/koha-common.init {start|stop|restart}
    => SUCCESS: No behaviour change
    - Disable the 'cgi' apache module:
      $ sudo a2dismod cgi
    - Run:
      $ debian/koha-common.init {start|stop|restart}
    => FAIL: No warning is shown
    - Apply the patch
    - Run:
      $ debian/koha-common.init {start|stop|restart}
    => SUCCESS: Warnings show up

    Bug 15758: [QA Follow-up] Final touch?
    
    From qa tools:
    reports/cat_issues_top.pl: pod: =over on line 39 without closing =back
    
    Note: qa tools does also report "options_for_libraries: not found" on two
    template includes. Considering this as a false alarm, since the block is
    defined in another include loaded in doc-head-open.
    [1] koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/includes/subscriptions-search.inc
    [2] koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/includes/opac-topissues.inc
    
    Found a template where a USE Branches was missing:
    koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/serials/subscription-add.tt
    Easy to spot since the libraries combo was empty.
    Tried to find similar occurrences with few greps, but couldn't find any.
    
    I did find duplicate USE Branches though in:
    koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/admin/smart-rules.tt
    koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/serials/checkexpiration.tt
    This patch removes them.

    Bug 15758: [QA Follow-up] Some corrections related to GetBranchName
    
    [1] Acquisition.pm
    The lines filling $row in GetBasketGroupAsCSV may have side-effects when
    the library name is not found. This change restores former behavior. Just
    theoretically more safe.
    Note that it also contained a typo: $row->{deliveryplace} should have been
    $row->{$place}.
    
    [2] Auth.pm
    checkauth: $branchname = Koha::Libraries->find($branchcode)->branchname;
    Should normally be fine, but I rather have an empty string here than
    crashing on "Can't call method branchname on undefined value".
    Same for sub check_api_auth.
    Note that this holds for a larger number of calls, but I am adding a check
    here because it is checkauth.
    Also removed a duplicate use Koha::Libraries-statement.
    
    [3] Search.pm
    Also removed a duplicate use statement for Libraries.
    
    [4] svc/holds

    Bug 15758: Koha::Libraries - Remove GetBranchName
    
    This is the fourth and last patch set to remove C4::Branch.
    The real purpose of this patch is to standardise and refactor some code
    which is related to the libraries selection/display.
    Its unconfessed purpose is to remove the C4::Branch package.
    
    Before this patch set, only 6 subroutines still existed in the C4::Branch
    package:
    - GetBranchName
    - GetBranchesLoop
    - mybranch
    - onlymine
    - GetBranches
    - GetBranch
    
    GetBranchName basically returns the branchname for a given branchcode.
    The branchname is only used for a display purpose and we don't need to
    retrieve it in package or pl scripts (unless for a few exceptions).
    We have a `Branches` template plugin with a `GetName` method which does
    exactly this job.
    To achieve this removal, we will use this template plugin and delete the
    GetBranchName from pl and pm files.
    The `Branches.all()` will now select the library of the logged in user
    if no `selected` parameter has been passed.
    This new behavior could cause regressions, for instance there are some
    places where we do not want an option preselected (batch item
    modification for instance), keep that in mind when testing.
    
    GetBranchesLoop took 3 parameters: $branch and $onlymine.
    The first one was used to set a "selected" flag, for a display purpose:
    select an option in the libraries dropdown lists.
    The second one was useless: If not passed or set to 0, the
    `C4::Branch::onlymine` subroutine was called.
    This onlymine flag was use to know if the logged in user was able to see
    other libraries infos.
    A patron can see the infos from other libraries if IndependentBranches
    is not set OR if he has the superlibrarian permission.
    Prior to this patch set, the "onlymine test" was done on different
    places (neworderempty.pl, additem.pl, holidays.pl, etc.), including the
    Branches TT plugin. In this patch set, this test is only done on one
    place (C4::Context::only_my_library, code moved from
    C4::Branch::onlymine).
    To accomplish the same job as this subroutine, we just need to call the
    `Branches.all()` method from the `Branches` TT plugin. It already
    accepts a `selected` parameter to set a flag on the option to select.
    To avoid the repetitive
      [% IF selected %]<option selected="selected">[% ELSE %]<option>[% END %]
    pattern, a new `html_helpers` TT include file has been created, it
    defines an `options_for_libraries` block, which takes a `selected`
    parameter. We could imagine to use this include file for other
    selects.
    
    The 'mybranch` and `onlymine` subroutines of the C4::Branch package have
    been moved to C4::Context. onlymine has been renamed with
    only_my_library. There are only 4 occurrences of it, against 11 before
    this patch set.
    There 2 subroutines are Context-centric and it makes sense to put them
    in `C4::Context` (at least it's the least worst place!)
    
    GetBranches is the tricky part of this patch set: It retrieves all the
    libraries, independently of the value of IndependentBranches.
    To keep the same way as the existing calls of `Branches.all()`, I have
    added a `unfiltered` parameter. If set, the `Branches.all()` will call
    a usual Koha::Libraries->search method, otherwise
    Koha::Libraries->search_filtered will be called. This new method will
    check if the logged in user is allowed to see other libraries or only
    its library.
    Note that this `GetBranches` subroutine also created a `category` key:
    it allowed to get the list of groups (of libraries) where this library
    existed. Thanks to a previous patch set (bug 15295), this value was
    not used anymore (I may have missed something!).
    
    Note that the only use of `GetBranch` was buggy (see bug 15746).
    
    Test plan (for the whole patch set):
    The best way to test this whole patch set is to test with 2 instances: 1
    with the patch set applied, 1 using master, to be sure there is no
    regression.
    It would be good to test the same with `IndependentBranches` and the
    without `IndependentBranches`.
    No difference should be found.
    The tester must focus on the library dropdowns on as many forms as
    possible.
    You will notice changes in the order of the options: the libraries will
    now be ordered by branchname (instead of branchcode in some places).
    A special attention will be given to the following page:
    - acqui/neworderempty.pl
    - catalogue/search.pl
    - members/members-home.pl (header?)
    - opac/opac-topissues.pl
    - tools/holidays.pl
    - admin/branch_transfer_limits.pl
    - admin/item_circulation_alerts.pl
    - rotating_collections/transferCollection.pl
    - suggestion/suggestion.pl
    - tools/export.pl
    
    Notes for QA:
    - There are 2 FIXMEs in the patch set, I have kept the existing behavior,
    but I am not sure it's the good one. Feel free to open a bug report and
    I will fill a patch if you think it's not correct. Otherwise, remove the
    FIXME lines in a follow-up patch.
    - The whole patch set is huge and makes a lot of changes.
    But it finally will tremendously reduce the number of lines:

    Bug 15407: [QA Follow-up] Confusing cathash removed
    
    One of the patches removed %cathash. Some kind of silly remainder
    was left in a string. Just used as a text field to explain the
    filters used on borrowers_stats.pl. The filter name cathash is not
    really easy and also was confusing in relation to the variable.
    
    So just a string patch, replacing it with Patron category.
    
    NOTE: The output of borrowers_stats.pl with the filters listed, is
    not one of the most beautiful Koha screens.
    Furthermore, translatibility of these filters is still an issue to
    be handled on another report.

    Bug 15407: Koha::Patron::Categories - replace GetborCatFromCatType
    
    This unnecessary complicated subroutine returned an arrayref and an
    hashref of the patron categories available for the logged in user, for a given
    category_type, ordered by categorycode.
    This can now be done with the search_limited method.
    
    Test plan:
    - Same prerequisite as before
    For the following pages, you should not see patron categories limited to other
    libraries. They should be ordered as before this patch, by categorycode.
    - Add/edit a patron, change his/her patron category value.
    - On the 3 following reports:
        reports/bor_issues_top.pl
        reports/borrowers_out.pl
        reports/cat_issues_top.pl
    The display for these 3 reports are different than the 2 from the first
    patch (borrowers_stats.pl issues_avg_stats.pl): they are ordered by
    categorycode and the ones limited to other libraries are not displayed
    (should certainly be fixed).
    
    Note that the big part of this patch has already been tested before
    (update child related: CATCODE_MULTI).

    Bug 15407: Koha::Patron::Categories - replace GetBorrowercategory
    
    The purpose of C4::Members::GetBorrowercategory was to return the patron
    category for a given categorycode. This can be done easily with the
    Koha::Patron::Categories->find method.
    
    Test plan:
    - Same prerequisite as before
    - Edit a guarantor and confirm the information will be updated for his/her
      guarantee(s).
    - Update a child to adult patron (Note: Should not we hide the patron
      categories limited to others libraries? If yes, it must be done on another
      bug report).
      There is a special behavior if there is only 1 adult category, the
      user does not need to select a category. So the same as before with
      only 1 adult patron category.
    - Import a patron with a category_code which does not exist. You should
      be warned.
    - Modify some patron using the batch patron modification tool. The
      patron category descriptions should correctly be displayed.
    
    Note that the overduerules page has already been tested in a previous
    patch.

    Bug 15407: Koha::Patron::Categories - replace C4::Category->all
    
    The C4::Category module contained only 1 method to return the patron
    categories available for the logged in user.
    The new method Koha::Patron::Categories->search_limited does exactly the
    same thing (see tests) and must be used in place of it.

    For the following pages, you should not see patron categories limited to
    other libraries.
    - On the 'Item circulation alerts' admin page
      (admin/item_circulation_alerts.pl), modify the settings for check-in
      and checkout (NOTE: Should not we display all patron categories on
      this page? If yes, it must be done in another bug report to ease
      backporting it).
    - Search for patrons in the admin (budget) and acquisition (order) module.
    - On the patron home page (search form in the header)

    Bug 15407: Koha::Patron::Categories - remove sql queries in some pl and pm
    
    This patch replaces sql queries done in some pl script and in
    C4::Reports::Guided.
    Since we have now a Koha::Patron::Categories module, we should use it
    where it is possible.
    
    Test plan:
    - Prerequisite: Be sure you have several patron categories created, with
      different option enabled, and limit some to certain libraries.
    - On the 'Circulation and fine rules' admin page (admin/smart-rules.pl),
      all the patron categories should be displayed (even the ones limited to
      another library), ordered by description. Try to add/update existing rules.
    - On the overdue rules page (tools/overduerules.pl), all the patron
      categories with overduenoticerequired set should be displayed.
      Try to add/update existing rules.
    - On the following reports:
        reports/borrowers_stats.pl
        reports/issues_avg_stats.pl
    The patron categories should be displayed. Note that there is an
    inconsistency with these 2 reports: the patron categories limited to
    other libraries are displayed on them, when they are not on the other
    reports. This should certainly be fixed (on another bug report).

    Bug 16035: MARC default bibliographic framework Export fix
    
    This patch makes sure that, if there is no framework code,
         $frameworkcode is set to 'default'. This fixes the format issue.
         Then, if $frameworkcode = default, an empty string (rather than
         null) is passed to the ExportFramework method, as the framework
         code in the DB for default codes is "".
    
    To test:
    1) Go to Admin -> MARC Bibliographic framework
    2) Try to export default framework in all formats, notice the file is
    only exported as .ods and is an empty file. Notice warns in intranet
    error log.
    3) Apply patch and refresh page
    4) Confirm exporting default framework works in all formats and
    spreadsheet has data
    5) Notice warns in error log are gone
    6) Confirm export still works for other frameworks

    Bug 14060: Remove readonly attributes on date inputs
    
    In order to remove accessibility issues due to the readonly attributes
    on date inputs, this patch will remove them and introduce a javascript
    validation on them.
    
    This patch is not perfect for some reason:
    I didn't manage to force the user to select a valid date. One solution
    would be to reopen the datepicker plugin until a valid date is inserted.
    But it could be annoying for users (and for me: I did not manage to
    implement this solution).
    You will note that input is emptied if the date is not valid. This is a
    quick and efficient solution to prevent submitting invalid date and make
    Koha explodes. A proper solution would be to implement the check server
    side send a friendly message to the user.
    
    Test plan:
    For all inputs, try an invalid and a valid date.
     1/ Debar a patron
     2/ On the checkout tables (circulation and moremember), add a renewal
    due date (at the bottom of the tables)
     3/ On the checkout page, specify a due date
     4/ On the return page, specify a return date
     5/ On the invoice page (acquisition module), enter a shipment and
    billing date
     6/ On the invoice search page (invoices.pl) use filters shipment and
    billing dates
     7/ On the offline circ page, specify a due date
     8/ On the edit patron page (memberentry), add a debarment
     9/ On the reserve page (reserve/request.pl), use the date inputs to
    suspend until a defined date
    10/ Edit patrons in a batch (tools/modborrowers.pl) and use the
    registration and expiry date inputs

    window. Instead, Koha appears to be using defaults.
    
    To reproduce:
    
    1. Open a record in the editor
    2. Switch from BKS to another material type.
    3. Change as many settings as possible.
    4. Close plugin.
    5. Reopen plugin - notice your selections are not shown.
    
    Trivial patch, heavilly inspired by Bug 9093.
    
    To test:
    
    1. Apply patch
    2. Ensure that issue described above is no longer reproductible

    Bug 11592: (QA followup) Add missing framework code to ViewPolicy filter calls
    
    This patch adds the frameworkcode option param, using each record's frameworkcode
    as expected by the filter. Otherwise the ViewPolicy filter falls back to the
    default framework.

    Bug 11592: MARCView and ISBD followup
    
    There are still some leaks, but it is not as a result
    of the filter, but rather a result of poorly written
    template files.
    
    Bug fixing template files is beyond the scope of this
    set of patches.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
     1) Backup your DB
     2) run the following SQL on your DB.
        > UPDATE marc_subfield_structure set hidden=-8;
        -- this should set EVERYTHING to hidden across the board.
     3) In staff client, set OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay to blank
     4) In OPAC, view any detail.
        -- Normal view may mostly leak values still.
        -- MARC view may leak values.
        -- ISBD view may leak values.
     5) In staff client, set OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay to default
     6) In OPAC, view any detail.
        -- same issues as step 4
        -- 'View Plain' may leak too.
     7) 'Save record' -> 'Dublin Core'
     8) Apply this patch
     9) run koha qa test tools
        -- should be fine
    10) prove -v t/db_dependent/Filter_MARC_ViewPolicy.t
        -- should pass
        -- this proves Koha/Filter/MARC/ViewPolicy.pm tweaks too
    11) In OPAC, view any detail.
        -- Normal view:
           -- Material type comes from the LEADER field.
           -- Lists this is on will still display
           -- 'Tags from this library' will still display
           -- Item information in table will still display
              (THIS IS BEYOND SCOPE)
        -- MARC view:
           -- Record number is leaked
              (THIS IS BEYOND SCOPE)
           -- 'View plain' leaks LEADER field.
        -- ISBD view may leak field headings, but not values.
           (THIS IS BEYOND SCOPE)
    12) In staff client, set OPACXSLTDetailsDisplay to blank
    13) In OPAC, view any detail.
        -- same kind of output as step 10
    14) 'Save record' -> BIBTEXT
        -- Should be next to nothing leaked.
    15) 'Save record' -> Dublin Core
        -- Should be the same or less leaked between the two versions.
        -- (XML FILTERING IS BEYOND SCOPE)
    16) In the staff client, go view the same record.
        -- it should be mostly hidden in ISBD View.
    17) run the following SQL on your DB.
        > UPDATE marc_subfield_structure set hidden=1;
        -- this should set EVERYTHING to hidden in OPAC, but not
           the STAFF across the board.
    18) Refresh the staff ISBD page
        -- values should reappear.
    19) View the ISBD details in the OPAC
        -- values should still be hidden.
    20) Check out the OPAC Cart and List
        -- while the intermediate pages may still leak
           the download links should leak very minimally.
        -- (CARTS AND LISTS ARE BEYOND SCOPE, THOUGH
            THE INTRANET ISBD AND SOME CART/LIST STUFF
            WERE FIXED BECAUSE OF THE GetISBDView REFACTOR)
    
    Expectations:
    Before Patch - all the OPAC Detail pages will display things
    After Patch - all the OPAC Detail pages will display much less,
                  and hopefully nothing (though there are known limits).
                  the ISBD detail page in the Staff client will be
                  filtered as well based on STAFF settings.
                  The saving/exporting should generate nearly empty
                  files.

    Bug 17189: Add the ability to define several memcached namespaces - Koha::Caches
    
    We need to define several namespaces for our cache system.
    For instance sysprefs, koha conf (koha-conf.xml) and unit tests
    should be defined in a separate namespace.
    This will permit to
    - launch the tests without interfering with other cache values
    - and flush the sysprefs cache without flushing all other values
    
    To do so, we need to store different Koha::Cache objects at a package
    level. That's why this patch adds a new Koha::Caches module.
    
    FIXME: There is an architecture problem here: the L1 cache should be
    defined in Koha::Cache

    Bug 11360 - Disable barcode field and submit button when a hold is found
    
    At the moment when scanning in returns, it can be easy to miss a hold
    trap due to the fact that the barcode and submit are still active and
    the barcode field is focused on. A librarian who is focused on scanning
    can easily scan another item and pass over the form, which is equivalent
    to clicking the "ignore" button.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Trap a hold, note the new modal
    3) Check the hold in a second time
    4) Note the new modal
    5) For each modal, test each button

    Bug 10848 - Allow configuration of mandatory/required fields on the suggestion form in OPAC
    
    This patch adds a configuration option which allows to define which
    fields should be mandatory for a patron purchase suggestion form in OPAC.
    
    Test plan:
    
    1/ Apply patch.
    2/ Play with the new OPACSuggestionMandatoryFields system preference
    (select some fields as manadatory, select all, deselect all, try to
    submit some suggestions with mandatory fields filled and/or not
    filled etc.) to ensure that required fields (and only required fields)
    are enforced in the browser to be filled.
    3/ With all options deselected, 'Title' field should still be
    mandatory (by default).

    Bug 10407: Add marcxml import (follow-up)
    
    This patch makes the following changes:
    
    [1] Based on the groundwork of the former patch, add call to
        RecordsFromMARCXMLFile in stage-marc-import. Use format param.
    [2] Add format to the template. Use file extension to determine.
        If you use .xml or .marcxml as extension, MARCXML is selected.
    [3] In stage-marc-import.tt mark UTF-8 encoding as UTF-8 not as utf8.
    [4] BatchStageMarcRecords: do not call plugin if you have no records.
    [5] RecordsFromISO2709File: also return errors in an array.
    [6] In misc/stage_file.pl also use UTF-8. Handling of errors from [5].
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Import an empty file as MARC or MARCXML (with Tools/Stage..import).
    [2] Import an non-empty file with invalid contents as MARC or MARCXML.
    [3] Export a few records with Tools/Export as MARC and MARCXML.
    [4] Import these two files. Check selected format versus file extension.
    [5] Import a MARCXML file with misc/stage_file.pl.

    Bug 10407: Resolve warnings from child process
    
    After the staging job finishes, the child tries to print results to
    STDOUT (which is closed). This creates warnings like:
    
    stage-marc-import.pl: binmode() on closed filehandle STDOUT at C4/Templates.pm line 120.
    stage-marc-import.pl: Filehandle STDOUT reopened as FH only for input at /usr/lib/perl5/Template/Provider.pm line 964.
    
    Resolving it is simple: the child should exit after marking the job
    as finished.
    
    Test plan:
    Import a marc file.
    Observe that you do no longer have such warnings.

    Bug 5456 - Create a link to opac-ics.pl
    
    opac-ics.pl was added to Koha back in 2007, but there has not been a link to it
    from anywhere. This patch adds the link from the main view on
    /cgi-bin/koha/opac-user.pl, and makes some changes to opac-ics.pl itself.
    
    Changes to opac-ics.pl:
    - Update the code to use date and time for when a loan is due
    - Use dt_from_string to turn a MySQL time and date into a DateTime
    - Add a timestamp and a UID (these were reported as necessary by a couple of
      iCal validators)
    - Remove DTEND from events, since we now have time as well as date for when a
      loan is due
    - For loans that are overdue, set the DTSTART to now(), to avoid creating
      calendar events in the past
    - Use a template to generate text strings, to make them translatable
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patch
    - Make sure you have at least a couple of loans, including one overdue
    - Go to /cgi-bin/koha/opac-user.pl and click on the link labeled "Download as
      iCal/.ics file"
    - Inspect the file in a text editor and/or view the result in a calendar
      appplication. Make sure the data makes sense.
    - Sign off and go thee merrily on thine way.
    
    Update 2016-07-25
    - Force date_due to UTC to avoid problematic timezone info like this:
      DTSTART:TZID=Europe/Zurich:20160724T235900
    - Remove quotes from summary and description
    
    Followed test plan, koha.ics file successfully imported to Thunderbird calendar

    Bug 17185: Staff client shows "Lists that include this title:" even if item is not in a list
    
    In the staff client, the text "Lists that include this title:"
    is always shown, regardless of whether the item is in a list
    or not. This patch fixes that.
    
    Test plan:
    1) Log in to staff client.
    2) Go to biblio details view:
       /cgi-bin/koha/catalogue/detail.pl?biblionumber=X
       Confirm that "Lists that include this title:" is
       shown even if the item is not in a list.
    3) Apply the patch.
    4) Repeat step 2. Confirm that the patch works, i.e.
       "Lists that include this title:" is only shown
       for biblios that are actually in a list.

    Bug 16809: Follow-up for scalarizing biblionumber
    
    Still resolves another multi_param warning.
    
    Test plan:
    Look at your logs before and after this patch when saving a biblio
    record (you may have to start plack again).
    If your biblionumber is mapped to 999c, you should no longer have a warn
    about line 2563 (disclaimer: line numbers are subject to change).

    Bug 16809: Silence authority warnings C4::Biblio::TransformHtmlToMarc
    
    Most of the floodiness is caused by accessing the cgi parameters
    in a context which is hard to determine. By purposefully saving
    the value to a scalar variable and using the variable, the issue
    disappears, and it will likely be a tiny tad faster as variable
    access is faster than multiple function calls.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
     1) Back up your intranet error log
        -- for example:
           cp ~/koha-dev/var/log/koha-error-log ~/koha-error-log.backup
     2) Blank your intranet error log
        -- for example:
           echo > ~/koha-dev/var/log/koha-error-log
     3) Log into your staff client
     4) Click 'Authorities'
     5) Click 'New from Z39.50'
     5) Type 'Seuss' into 'Name (any):' and press enter
     6) Click 'Import' beside the first link
     7) Click 'Save'
     8) Check your koha-error-log
        -- floody!
     9) Apply patch
    10) repeat steps 2-8
        -- blank!
    11) restore your intranet error log
       -- for example:
          mv ~/koha-error-log.backup ~/koha-dev/var/log/koha-error-log
    12) run koha qa test tools

    Bug 14612 - Overdue notice triggers should show branchname instead of branchcode
    
    This patch adds the Branches template plugin to the overdue notice
    triggers template so that the library name can be shown instead of the
    branchcode.
    
    Also changed: Updated page title to match the name used in tools menus.
    
    To test, apply the patch and go to Tools -> Overdue notice/status
    triggers.
    
    - Select a library.
    - When the page reloads, the 'Defining overdue actions for...' and
      'Rules for overdue actions: ' headings should show the library name
      instead of the branchcode.

    Bug 17228 - Make two versions of SIPconfig.xml identical
    
    Several bugs have made changes to etc/SIPconfig.xml but not
    updated debian/templates/SIPconfig.xml. This means that an admin
    using the Debian packages who enables SIP2 for a site and looks at
    /etc/koha/sites/<instance>/SIPconfig.xml will not see an up-to-date
    version of that file, with the risk of missing possible config
    opportunities.
    
    Since debian/templates/SIPconfig.xml contains no placeholders or
    other magic stuff related to the Debian packaging, this patch simply
    copies etc/SIPconfig.xml to debian/templates/SIPconfig.xml
    
    To test: diff etc/SIPconfig.xml debian/templates/SIPconfig.xml
    There should be no difference between the files

    3) Issue an item with manual renewal.
    4) Place a hold on both items.
    5) Log in as patron and note that the column "Renew" says "Automatic
       renewal (x of y renewals remaining)" for the auto renewed item
       and "(On hold) for the other item.
    6) Apply patch.
    7) Refresh OPAC and note that now "Not renewable (on hold)" is displayed
       for both items.
    8) Cancel the holds, then log in as patron again and confirm that the
       correct renewal conditions are displayed.

    Bug 7045: Use <<tag>> for default value placeholders
    
    When adding a biblio, the default value of a MARC subfield defined in
    the frameworks can be used as placeholders to set the current date or
    the surname of the logged in user (use cases?).
    The different placeholders are 'YYYY', 'MM', 'DD', 'user'.
    When adding an item, same behavior except that 'user' is not replaced.
    
    This patch makes behaviors consistent between the 2 editors and
    surrounds placeholders with << >>
    We will now have: <<YYYY>>, <<MM>>, <<DD>> and <<USER>>
    
    Test plan:
    Define default values for biblio and item subfields.
    Create a bibliographic record and attach it an item.
    The default values should be used and replaced if you used placeholders.

    Bug 17118: (follow-up 15381) Fix regression when clearing a linked authority
    
    Changes made on bug 15381 assumed that the authid was always set.
    But if the user wants to clear the field of the authority, the script is
    called with authid=0 (FIXME...)
    
    To fix this issue, it's better to move the new calls to
      Koha::Authorities->find($authid)->authtypecode
    and
      Koha::Authority::Types->find($authtypecode);
    at the correct place
    
    Test plan:
    1. Edit a record which has a field linked to an
       authority record (100a for instance).
    2. Click the link which triggers the tag editor.
       A pop-up window should be displayed.
    3. In the pop-up window, click the "Clear field"
       button.
    => Without this patch A second pop-up window opens and displays an error:
      Can't call method "authtypecode" on an undefined value at /authorities/blinddetail-biblio-search.pl line 61.
    => With this patch applied the field is correctly cleared.

    Bug 16449: Remove "no method selected" warning from unimarc_field_4XX
    
    Because of bug 14828, the unimarc_field_4XX now raises a warning:

    Signed-off-by: Marcel de Rooy <m.de.rooy@rijksmuseum.nl>
    
    Tested the A;B;C variant here. If A fails, B will run. Since we can safely
    assume that A (or B) will not fail on a daily basis, this seems to be better
    than running them in the wrong order every day.
    
    As the comments on Bugzilla show, several people support this improved
    (reordered) scheme and look forward to improved error handling on another
    report (obviously not that simple).

    Bug 11144: Fix sequence of cronjobs: automatic renewal - fines - overdue notices
    
    The patch changes the sequence of cronjobs in the crontab example
    file and in the cron.daily file of the packages.
    
    This is why:
    1) Renew automatically
       ... only when we can't renew, we want to
    2) Calculate fines
       ... once the fine are calculated and charged
       we can print the amount into the
    3) Overdue notices
    
    Before the change it could happen that you'd charge for an item,
    that would then be renewed. Or that you'd try to print fine
    amounts into the overdue notices, when they would only be
    charged moments later.
    
    To test:
    - configure your system so you have items that should
      - be charged with fines
      - renew automatically
    - configure your crontabs according to the example file
      or switch the cron.daily in your package installation with
      the new one
    - configure your overdue notices so that one should be generated
      <<items.fine>>
    - Wait for the cronjobs or schedule them to run earlier
    - Verify all is well and as it should be

    When user does not have required permissions to use API operation, it would be

    Bug 14868: Give users possibility to request their own object
    
    Allow access to user's own objects even if they do not have required permissions.
    This will be very useful in many cases where an user wants to request their own
    object, for example renewing their checkouts or placing a hold for themselves.
    
    First, this patch renames "x-koha-permission" to "x-koha-authorization" in order
    to describe the new functionality better.
    
    Second, we can now add two extra parameters under "x-koha-authorization":
    - "allow-owner"; Allows the owner of object to access it (without permission)
    - "allow-guarantor"; Allows guarantor of the owner of object to access it
                         (without permission)
    
    Third, since permission checking is outside of actual controller, we need a way
    to find out ownership from different types of parameters, e.g. checkout_id from
    /checkouts/{checkout_id}, borrowernumber from /patrons/{borrowernumber} etc.
    A solution is to match the parameter with a subroutine that is designed to verify
    the ownership for that object. See the new subroutines in Koha::REST::V1.
    
    To use this functionality you will simply define it in Swagger:
    "/patrons/{borrowernumber}": {
      "get": {
        ...,
        "x-koha-authorization": {
          "allow-owner": true,
          "permissions": {
            "borrowers": "1"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    If a parameter that is not yet defined in Koha::REST::V1::check_object_ownership,
    you also need to define it and implement a subroutine that determines ownership.
    
    Tests are provided in a following patch that adds this functionality for current
    API operations.

    Bug 14868: Swagger2-driven Permission checking
    
    Define 'x-koha-permission' for the Swagger2 Operation Object, to automatically
    authorize against the required permissions.
    
    This way we immediately tell the API consumer in the Swagger2-definition, which
    permissions are needed to access defined resources.
    Also we don't need to maintain permissions in multiple locations and we can build
    a smart testing framework to help a lot in creating tests for the new REST API.

    Bug 16699: Support multiple types in primitive definitions
    
    Currently it is not possible to define multiple types for primitive definitions
    in /definitions/*. If you try to use the following
    "firstname": {
      "type": ["string", "null"],
      "description": "patron's first name"
    }
    in definitions.json, online.swagger.io validator will not validate it:
    {"messages":["attribute definitions.firstname.type is not of type `string`"]}
    
    One way to get around this issue is to extend definitions with custom
    "x-primitives" object, where we will define all reusable primitive definitions.
    
    To test:
    1. Add the "firstname" example above to definitions.json
    2. Run minifySwagger.pl
    3. Validate your specification
    4. Observe that error with description mentioned above is given
    5. Apply patch
    6. Repeat step 2 and 3
    7. Observe that validation passes

commit 0eaf72ab26457929a8485e5f3dc183452300794b
Author: Lari Taskula <larit@student.uef.fi>
Date:   Thu Jun 9 16:13:53 2016 +0300

    Bug 16699: Split parameters and paths in Swagger
    
    Parameters and paths should be split in our Swagger specification, because
    otherwise swagger.json would become messy with all the paths and their
    further specification in the same file. Also parameters should be split
    for the same reason.
    
    Instead of using index.json for definitions, parameters and paths, we define
    new files "definitions.json", "parameters.json" and "paths.json" in order to
    simplify the references. If we kept using index.json and try to reference
    "/definitions/error.json" from "/paths/holds.json", reference would be
    "../definitions/index.json#/error" instead of now simplified version,
    "../definitions.json#/error".
    
    Here is the proposed structure:
    
    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ swagger.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ definitions.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paths.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parameters.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ definitions
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ error.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ patron.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parameters
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ patron.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ paths
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ patrons.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ minifySwagger.pl
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ swagger.min.js
    
    The swagger.json paths, definitions and parameters will look as follows:
    ...
      "paths": {
        "$ref": "paths.json"
      },
      "definitions": {
        "$ref": "definitions.json"
      },
      "parameters": {
        "$ref": "parameters.json"
      }
    ...
    
    A problem with splitting specification into multiple files directly from
    swagger.json (e.g. "paths": { "$ref": "paths.json" }) is that it is not
    following the Swagger specification and an error will be thrown by the
    Swagger-UI default validator (online.swagger.io/validator).
    
    To overcome this problem, we use the minifySwagger.pl script from Buug 16212.
    This allows the developers to work with the structure introduced in this patch
    thus allowing developers to split the specification nicely, and still have a
    valid Swagger specification in the minified swagger.min.json.
    
    To test:
    -2: Apply the minifier-patch in Buug 16212.
    -1: Make sure you can validate your specification with Swagger2 validator at
        online.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=url_to_swaggerjson, or install it
        locally from https://github.com/swagger-api/validator-badge.
    
    1. Don't apply this patch yet, but first validate swagger.json
       with swagger.io-validator (or your local version, if you installed it)
    2. Observe that validation errors are given
    3. Run minifySwagger.pl
    4. Validate swagger.min.json with the validator you used in step 1
    5. Observe that validation passes and we overcame the invalid specification
       problem in swagger.min.json
    6. Apply this patch
    7. Run minifySwagger.pl
    8. Repeat step 4
    9. Observe that validation passes with new structure
    10. Run REST tests at t/db_dependents/api/v1
    
    (11. Study the new structure of our Swagger specifications :))

    Bug 16212 - Generate initial swagger.min.json file

    Bug 16212: Use swagger.min.json insted of swagger.json
    
    Our current approach with splitting the Swagger specification brings problems.
    For example, in swagger.json, if we split the whole "definitions" object with
    $ref, validations will fail with online.swagger.io validator.
    
    (See http://online.swagger.io/validator/debug?url=url_to_your_swagger_json)
    
    The problem also occurs with "paths" (Paths Object), because simply $ref to all
    paths for example in /paths/index.json does not meet the Swagger2 specification.
    
    The problem is solved by using the minification script and the minified version
    of swagger.json after which the swagger.min.json is valid Swagger2 specification,
    because the minifier resolves the problematic $refs of swagger.json file in the
    minified version.

    Bug 16212: Add script minifySwagger.pl
    
    This patch introduces the misc/devel/minifySwagger.pl script that
    loads the Swagger files, follows references and produces a compact
    ("minified") version of the swagger file which is suitable for
    distribution.
    
    The wiki page should be updated with instructions on how to regenerate

    Bug 14390: [Follow-up] Only update FU record in UpdateFine
    
    Exclude O, F and M when outstanding == 0.
    Check if the issue_id points to a FU record.
    
    Note: We only warn now when we see a second FU record with this issue id.
    That should be a rare exception. As before, we are just counting it in
    our total. Added a FIXME.

    Bug 15023: Allow patron anonymize/bulk delete tool to be limited by branch
    
    This patch makes the bulk patron delete/anonymize functionality be limited
    by branch. It does so by adding a branch selection dropdown and using the
    already defined APIs for filtering by branch.
    
    It makes use of C4::Branches::onlymine for the IndependentBranches use case
    and it adds a way to call it from the Branches template plugin.
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patch
    1) Have a superlibrarian user
    - Go to Tools > Batch patron deletion/anonymization
    => SUCCESS: Verify you can pick a branch (or all of them)
    - Try doing some operations
    => SUCCESS: Verify the selection is respected, and carried around all steps
    2) Have a user with tools/delete_anonymize_patrons permissions
    - Set IndependentBranches on
    - Go to Tools > Batch patron deletion/anonymization
    => SUCCESS: It picks the librarian's branch and doesn't let us choose another one
    - Try doing some operations
    => SUCCESS: Verify the user's branch is respected, and carried around all steps
    - Sign off :-D

    Bug 17050: (QA followup) Use Mojo::Transaction to get the remote address
    
    While the original patch fixes the issue, reading at Mojolicious source code, revealed
    that Mojo::Transaction already has proper processing for detecting the remote address:
    
    sub remote_address {
      my $self = shift;
    
      return $self->original_remote_address(@_) if @_;
      return $self->original_remote_address unless $self->req->reverse_proxy;
    
      # Reverse proxy
      return ($self->req->headers->header('X-Forwarded-For') // '') =~ /([^,\s]+)$/
        ? $1
        : $self->original_remote_address;
    }
    
    Without this patch, if there's a request without HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, then the remote
    address would be empty. Such would be the case of a dev/standard setup without Plack.
    
    This patch makes Koha::REST::V1::startup use tx->remote_address instead of dealing with the
    headers on its own.

    Bug 17050: Do not kick the session out when accessing the REST API
    
    Mojolicious does not set $ENV{REMOTE_ADDR} (neither $ENV{HTTP_*}) as
    it may share ENV between different requests.
    Fortunately for us, Plack does not!
    
    This is a dirty patch to fix this issue but it seems that there is not
    lot of solutions. It adds a remote_addr parameter to
    C4::Auth::check_cookie_authin order to send it from
    Koha::Rest::V1::startup reading the headers sent by Mojolicious.

    Hit /cgi-bin/koha/mainpage.pl
    Hit /api/v1/patrons/42
    Hit /cgi-bin/koha/mainpage.pl
    
    With this patch applied, everything will be fine and you won't be

    Bug 17001: fix due date filter on the overdue report
    
    When the TimeFormat system preference is set to "12 hour",
    setting a filter on the due date can result in:
    
    - no overdue loans being reported, even if there are some
      that meet the criteria
    
    OR
    
    - overdue loans being omitted from the report if they
      are due on the "until" date in the filter
    
    This patch fixes this by replacing output_pref() with
    DateTime::Format::MySQL to format the date filter values
    to pass to the SQL query.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Run the overdue report (circ/overdue.pl) and set a filter
        on due date, using values that should bring up one or
        more overdue loans.
    [2] Note that zero overdue loans are returned (if using MySQL
        5.5, 5.6, or 5.7 or MariaDB 5) or that loans due on the
        "until" date are omitted (if using MarioDB 10).
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the correct
        set of overdue loans should be reported.

    Bug 17117: Patron personal details not displayed unless branch update request is enabled
    
    In patron acount ("your personal details" tab, which serves as a form
    for submitting update requests as well) it's not possible to display
    some account details like expiration date etc., without enabling
    the field for branch / library update requests too.
    
    To reproduce:
    
    1) set OPACPatronDetails to "Allow"
    2) clear PatronSelfModificationBorrowerUnwantedField preference
    - all possible fields in the update requests form are visible
    in patron account, including some extra details (card number,
    expiration date, category) in the "Library" section on top
    3) put 'branchcode' in PatronSelfModificationBorrowerUnwantedField preference
    4) the whole 'Library' section disappears
    
    To test:
    
    1) apply patch
    2) put 'branchcode' in PatronSelfModificationBorrowerUnwantedField,
    'Library' section should remain visible (sans branch selection option)
    3) put 'branchcode|cardnumber|datexpiry|categorycode' in the same
    preference, 'Library' section should now disappear

    Bug 17097: Fix CSRF in deletemem.pl
    
    If an attacker can get an authenticated Koha user to visit their page
    with the url below, they can delete patrons details.
    
      /members/deletemem.pl?member=42
    
    Test plan:
    
    0/ Do not apply any patches
    1/ Adapt and hit the url above
    => The patron will be deleted without confirmation
    2/ Apply first patch
    3/ Hit the url
    => you will get a confirmation page
    4/ Hit /members/deletemem.pl?member=42&delete_confirmed=1
    => The patron will be deleted without confirmation
    5/ Apply the second patch (this one)
    6/ Hit /members/deletemem.pl?member=42&delete_confirmed=1
    => you will get a crash "Wrong CSRF token" (no need to stylish)
    7/ Delete a patron from the detail page and confirm the deletion
    => you will be redirected to the patron module home page and the patron
    has been deleted

    Bug 16955: Do not clear from cache when adding a new framework
    
    There are several issues with these lines:
    1/ $cache is not defined correctly and it not visible inside
    duplicate_framework
    2/ $frameworkcode is a wrong c/p, it should be $newframeworkcode
    3/ these calls are not needed. As we are creating a new framework, the cache
    should be empty...
    
    This patch will simply remove these calls
    
    Test plan:
    Duplicate a framework and confirm that you do not get any error in your
    logs.

    Bug 16996: Do not explode if mandatory fields are missing
    
    At the OPAC, if a patron modify his/her information and at least 1
    mandatory field is missing, Koha will crash with
      Template process failed: undef error - Can't call method "description"
    
    It is raised by Koha::Template::Plugin::Categories::GetName called with
    an undefined categorycode.
    The problem is that the values sent originaly are not sent back to the
    template if the user missed something.
    This patch makes that all info are resent to the template in order to
    show the same form to the user.
    
    Test plan:
    0. Apply patch
    
    1. Make sure that the categorycode is not hidden in the OPAC in:
         PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerUnwantedField or PatronSelfModificationBorrowerUnwantedField
    
    2. Add a required field in PatronSelfRegistrationBorrowerMandatoryField, for example email.
    
    3. Go to Your Personal Details in the OPAC (opac-memberentry.pl) and leave blank the required field of point 2
    
    4. Press "Submit update request"
    
    There should be no software error.
    
    NOTE: The warns will be floody on the logs.

    Bug 16615: Open Library API fails for full-site-SSL
    
    When running Koha in a full-site-SSL configuration accessing
    external resouces like Open Library cover images via HTTP
    doesn't work (mixed SSL/non-SSL content). It thus breaks a
    core feature of Koha. Referencing such resources always via
    HTTPS resolves the problem and also enhances privacy as a
    side-effect.
    
    Previous tickets took care of Amazon resources. This ticket
    is supposed to address the remaining external resource providers,
    starting with Open Library.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
    1) Over https access your OPAC with the Enhanced Content system
       preferences 'OpenLibraryCovers' set to 'Add', and
       'OpenLibrarySearch' set to 'Show'.
    2) Search for something (e.g. Mo Willems)
       -- Your browser console log will show messages about
          mixed content.
    3) Apply the patch
    4) Making sure to reload the java script, attempt steps 1 & 2
       again.
       -- no mixed content messages should be given
    5) run koha qa test tools

    Bug 14844: Corrupted storable string. When adding/editing an Item, cookie LastCreatedItem might be corrupted.
    
    No idea how to replicate this issue but we have been getting several reports
    about the following error:
    
    Software error:
    
    Corrupted storable string (binary v2.9) at /usr/lib/perl/5.18/Storable.pm line
    417, at /home/koha/kohaclone/cataloguing/additem.pl line 375.
    
    TEST PLAN:
    1. Add or modify an Item.
    2. No observed changes.
    ?. We don't know what causes this but we know that add/modify Item occasionally
       crashes due to failure of a cookie thawing.
    
    This patch prevents the whole program from dying, because this error is not
    critical enough to warrant dying.
    Also there is no centralized mechanism in Koha for showing messages to the
    user, so there is no easy and convenient way to warn the user that the:
    'LastCreatedItem'-cookie or the systempreference 'PrefillItem' is
    malfunctioning.
    
    So we instead just warn to the server logs with the malfunctioning cookie in
    hopes of nailing down what causes the issues.

    Bug 17103 - Google API Loader jsapi called over http
    
    This patch replaces the hardcoded protocol ("http") from the URI with
    https since that is what Google defacto uses to serve JS resources
    Prevents MIXED CONTENT failure, allowing GoogleIndicTransliteration
    to function correctly when used in SSLized OPACs.
    
    Test plan
    ---------
    
    1/ Make sure your OPAC is being served both over HTTP and HTTPS
    2/ Set GoogleIndicTransliteration syspref to "Show"
    3/ Access the OPAC over http, Google transliteration element will
       show up in masthead searchbox.
    4/ Access the OPAC over https. The element will not show. Console
       will show MIXED CONTENT error and failure of google loader.
    5/ Apply patch. Repeat steps #3 and #4 again. Now in both cases
       GoogleIndicTransliteration will work.

    Bug 16974: Make koha-plack should check and fix log files permissions
    
    This patch adds a function to the koha-plack script so it checks for log file
    existence and its permissions. This function is called from the start_plack function.
    
    If some of this conditions are not fulfilled, it solves the situation by either
    touching and/or changing the permissions accordingly for the instances' plack log files.
    
    To test:
    - Run (on kohadevbox):
      $ cd kohaclone
      $ debian/scripts/koha-plack --start kohadev
      $ debian/scripts/koha-plack --stop  kohadev
      $ ls /var/log/koha/kohadev/plack*
    - Verify ownership of the created files (they might belong to the root user)
    - Apply the patch
    - Run:
      $ chown root:root /var/log/koha/kohadev/plack*
      $ debian/scripts/koha-plack --start kohadev
      $ ls /var/log/koha/kohadev/plack*

    Bug 16885: koha-stop-zebra should be more sure of stopping zebrasrv
    
    This patch follows Galen's suggestion in comment #7.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
    1) Back up your koha logs as desired.
    2) add something to /var/log/koha/{instance name}/intranet-error.log
    3) ps aux | grep zebra
    4) logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/koha-common
    5) ps aux | grep zebra
       -- the zebrasrv and daemon process for zebra indexing
          didn't restart.
    6) apply this patch against /usr/sbin/koha-stop-zebra
    7) sudo koha-start-zebra {instance name}
    8) ps aux | grep zebra
       -- the processes should have started up again.
    9) add different junk to /var/log/koha/{instance name}/intranet-error.log
    10) ps aux | grep zebra
    11) logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/koha-common
    12) ps aux | grep zebra
        -- the process ids for the zebrasrv and daemon processes should
           be different, but the number of processes is the same as before.
    13) sign off, because its less ugly than comment #3

    3-Use an email without at sing (@)
    4-Notice that there is no error
    5-Save
    6-Go to the vendor created (/cgi-bin/koha/acqui/supplier.pl?booksellerid=1)
    7-Click in Website: koha-community.org -> redirect to an 404 error
    8-Notice the bad mailto:
    
    To test:
    -Apply patch
    -Reproduce step 1 to 8 with the same vendor or create a new one
    -Enter multiple wrong and valid urls
    -Enter urls with and without protocols http, https, ftp
    -Enter wrong and valid emails

    Bug 16989 - Advanced search form does not display translated itemtype
    
    In Staff client, the advanced serach form does not display the
    translations of item types.
    
    (Note: It is not necessary to have translations installed to verify
    this bug.)
    
    Prerequisites:
    - Go to Home > Administration > Item types administration
    - Edit e.g. item type "BK" (Book)
    - Near "Description", click link "Translate into other languages
    - If you have other languaes installed, add translatons for those
    - If you have an Englis only installation, add a "translation" for
      English, make sure that you can identify it while testing (I
      used "BOOOOOOOOOOOOKS")
    
    Verify:
    - Go to Home ‚Ä∫ Advanced search
    - Verify near "Limit to any of the following" that the description for
      itemtype BK reads "Book" instead of "BOOOOOOOOOOOOKS"
    
    Test:
    - Apply patch
    - Verify that the item type description now reads ""BOOOOOOOOOOOOKS"
    - If you have a multi language installaton, verify that item types
      you translated display as appropriate

    Bug 17055 - Add classes to different note types to allow for styling on checkins page
    
    Returned items may have 3 kinds of notes, patron, item public, and item
    non-public. However, the html markup for them does not allow us to
    distinguish which type we are seeing. It would be good to add classes
    for each of these note types.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Check out an item to a patron
    2) Add a patron note, a public item note, and a non-public item note
       to the patron and item you used
    3) Check in the item and instead the html, note the each note span
       now has a class to distinguish which type of note is being displayed.

    Bug 16776: Do not forget external language choice in language switcher
    
    If language is set by external link language switcher does not work
    
    To reproduce:
    
    - Have a multilingual koha installation, let's say en, de-CH, fr-FR and it-IT
    - Create external links e.g. from your multilingual library website to each language variant of OPAC:
    
    ...cgi-bin/koha/opac-main.pl?language=en
    ...cgi-bin/koha/opac-main.pl?language=de-CH
    ...cgi-bin/koha/opac-main.pl?language=fr-FR
    ...cgi-bin/koha/opac-main.pl?language=it-IT
    
    Each link opens fine displaying the language as appropriate.
    
    Now try to switch language on the page you just opened via the external link.
    
    It won't work, it will always stay on the language defined by the external link.
    
    To test:
    - Apply patch
    - Repeat steps above
    - Verify that the language switcher works
    - Verify in browser address field that after switching language, the param 'language= 'has vanished from url string
    - Try links with multiple params and with params containing 'language', e.g.
      ...cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl?language=fr-FR&q=language&mylanguage=test
    - Verify that only the parameter 'language=' vanishes

    Bug 17074: Fix links in result list of 'scan indexes' and keep search term visible
    
    The 'scan indexes' search that can be reached from the
    advanced search has 2 problems to begin with:
    
    - The search term you searched for is not displayed
      in the input field.
    - The links in the result list are missing the index
      and because of that, are not giving the correct results.
    
    To test:
    - Go to the advanced search, select an index to search in
    - Enter a search term and check 'scan indexes'
    - Submit search
    - Check if the search term is visible in the input box
    - Check if the result links contain your selected index
      and give you correct results (count and the number of
      results should match)
    
    Tested both patches together, works as expected.

    Bug 17053 Clearing search term in Reports
    
    If you click the clear button to clear the search term it does take the search
    term away. However, the next time you click on "Saved reports" the search term
    is still there.
    
    TO TEST:
    
    1. Reports > Use saved
    2. Filter on anything (date/author/keyword). Let say "foo" in keyword.
    3. Click the Clear link on the Filter form. You can see that "foo" is removed
       from keyword, and all the saved reports are displayed.
    4. Click "Saved Reports" on the left. You can see that "foo" reappears in
       keyword filter.
    5. Apply the patch, and repeat steps 2-4.

    Bug 16929: Prevent opac-memberentry waiting for random chars
    
    Move calls to WWW::CSRF to Koha::Token.
    Send a safe random string to WWW::CSRF instead of letting CSRF make a
    blocking call to Bytes::Random::Secure. If your server has not enough
    entropy, opac-memberentry will hang waiting for more characters in
    dev/random. Koha::Token uses Bytes::Random::Secure with the NonBlocking
    flag.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Do not yet apply this patch.
    [2] If your server has not enough entropy, calling opac-memberentry may
        take a while. But this not may be the case for you (no worries).
    [3] Apply this patch.
    [4] Verify that opac-memberentry still works as expected.
    [5] Run t/Token.t

    Bug 7441 - search results showing wrong branch?
    
    When you search in the OPAC it shows you the HOME branch on the location
    in XSLT, but if you click through to the detail page it shows you the
    CURRENT BRANCH in the holdings table which is very confusing to patrons.
    I don't know what's the right solution - home or holding branch, but they
    should be the same in both places for the patron's sake. If you do the same
    search in the staff client you see the right branch info on the search results
    and on the detail page.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Run updatedatabase.pl
    3) Search the catalog, you search should include results with items
       that have different home and holding libraries.
    4) The results should look the same as before the patch
    5) Change the system preference OPACResultsLibrary to "current location"
    6) Refresh your page of search results
    7) The results show now show the holding library instead of the home library

    Bug 17069: Koha::Patron::Category->store must default checkprevcheckout to 'inherit'
    
    Creating a new patron category raises an error "An error occurred when updating
    this patron category. Perhaps it already exists."
    DBIx::Class does not default to the value defined at the DB devel if the
    key checkprevcheckout has been passed to the constructor.
    We may need to provide a global fix for this kind of issue: if a column
    is defined as "not null" but has a default value, the constructor
    (Koha::Object->new) should not pass it to the DBIx::Class constructor
    (even if assuming that null means default is a terrible mysqlism).
    
    Test plan:
    Create a new patron category.
    
    Works as expected.

    Bug 17030: Make REST api available on packages with plack enabled
    
    This patch is the starting point for making the REST api available
    on Plack.
    
    What it does:
    - It creates the /api/v1/app.pl mount point in plack.psgi
    - It enables the ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse directives so it
      is reached through Plack.
    - It sets rewrite rules so we can use the 'pretty' urls (i.e.
      /api/v1/patrons instead of /api/v1/app.pl/api/v1/patrons).
    
    To test:
    - Grab the following files, and put them in /etc/koha (overwrite the existing ones)
      debian/templates/apache-shared-intranet-plack.conf
      debian/templates/apache-shared-opac-plack.conf
    - Tweak your /etc/koha/sites/kohadev/plack.psgi file so the API-related stuff
      is present on your file.
    - Make sure Plack is enabled for the instance:
      $ sudo koha-plack --enable kohadev
      $ sudo koha-plack --restart kohadev
      $ sudo service apache2 restart
    - Follow the previous patch test plan, but use this URLs (no pretty URL):
    
      http://localhost:8080/api/v1/app.pl/api/v1/patrons/50
      http://localhost:8081/api/v1/app.pl/api/v1/patrons/50
    => SUCCESS: You get a JSON response from the API [1]
    - Not use this URLs:
      http://localhost:8080/api/v1/patrons/50
      http://localhost:8081/api/v1/patrons/50
    => SUCCESS: You get a JSON response from the API [1]
    - Sign off :-D
    
    [1] this patch made a bug visible (the session is lost when accessing the API through
    Plack) but it shouldn't prevent its inclusion because the API right now is not even available
    as default for developers to test or fix it.

    Bug 17030: Enable REST api on packages
    
    This patch enables access to the REST API endpoint on packages setup.
    It does so, by patching the shared apache-shared-intranet.conf and
    apache-shared-opac.conf.
    
    You can build your own master packages with this patch applied, or just:
    
    - Grab
      debian/templates/apache-shared-intranet.conf
      debian/templates/apache-shared-opac.conf
    and overwrite their counterparts in /etc/koha on a packages setup. For example
    in kohadevbox.
    - Have Koha loaded with all default data
    - Create a superlibrarian user for you
    - Login to the intranet and the OPAC
    - Point your browser to:
      http://localhost:8080/api/v1/patrons/51
    => SUCCESS: You get JSON data, for the patron you requested
      http://localhost:8081/api/v1/patrons/51
    => SUCCESS: You get JSON data, for the patron you requested
    - Sign off :-D

    Bug 16868: Silence error t/db_dependent/Linker_FirstMatch.t
    
    When the auth_header table has records which exclude 1xx and
    2xx tags, the $bibfield doesn't match anything. This in turn
    sets it to undef, which triggers an error on the next line
    killing the test.
    
    This was completely refactored to provide the data necessary
    for the tests to pass, and to be more comprehensive (both MARC
    and UNIMARC are tested). The tests are then run.
    
    C4::Headings::authorities is mocked, so that this test is not
    dependent on a search engine.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
    1) back up DB
    2) DELETE FROM auth_header;
    3) SOURCE auth_header.sql;
       -- the provided file
    4) prove t/db_dependent/Linker_FirstMatch.t
       -- should barf before running all the tests
    5) apply all patches
    6) prove t/db_dependent/Linker_FirstMatch.t
       -- should work happy
    7) run koha qa test tools
    8) restore your backup

    Bug 16878: Fix XSS in opac-memberentry
    
    The vars are gotten from the url and sent to the template as it. They
    must be escaped.
    
    Test plan:
    I have not managed to create the original issue, so there is no test
    plan for the XSS fix, but you can confirm there is no regression.

    This patch removes one use of "onclick" in favor of defining events in
    the JavaScript.
    
    This patch also makes changes to the style of some buttons to make the
    interface a little more consistent with current practices.
    
    To test, apply the patch and go to Administration -> Audio alerts.
    
    - In the list of existing audio alerts, click the "Edit" button for any
      alert. The correct data should be loaded in the edit form.

    Bug 15397 - Pay selected does not works as expected
    
    When patron has more fees (account lines) and you wan't to pay just some
    of them, you select wanted lines a click on "pay selected" button. But
    the fine isn't paid, the "amountoutstandig" is not modified, but it is
    added new line with "pay" code an with amountoutstanding below zero.
    Paying one or all fine works as expected. Paying selected worked some
    time ago, but I don't know when it stopped working, we realize it after
    upgrade to 3.22.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Pay fines using "Pay selected"
    3) Note the payment and the fees outstanding balances are reduced!

    Bug 16573: fix structure and sample data for MySQL 5.7
    
    Web install on Ubuntu 16.04/Mysql 5.7 fails.
    
    This patch makes small changes to make installation
    possible to kohastructure.sql and some sample files.
    
    Sample values for quotes table can't have '0000-00-00 ...' values
    nor NULL values, now() is perhaps an option.
    
    Depends on Bug 16572
    
    To test:
    1) System with MySQL 5.7, for example Ubuntu 16.05
    2) Apply 16572
    3) Try web install, it fails
    4) Apply this and next patch
    5) Try again, now it succeed
    
    This is only for English install, i18n files needs revision
    I can do that if this is accepted.
    
    Perphaps a change is needed to updatedatabase.pl
    
    Ammended patch, 'created_on' field on virtualshelves
    can't be timestamp default null, mysql 5.5 complains
    that only one timestamp column can be defined as
    default not null. Changed to 'datetime' type.
    
    Can provide followup with updatedabase change,
    but need an opinion if this type change makes sense.

    Mysql < 5.7 replaced this with nearest right value, i.e 0
    Mysql 5.7 gives error here.

    On top of Bug 16572 and previous patch
    
    1) Run webinstaller
    2) Add mandatory values
    3) There must be no problems on MySQL 5.7

    Bug 16847: Remove C4::Members::GetTitles
    
    This subroutine just reads the content of a pref, split it, add an
    empty string and returns.
    It is not really useful and the code in the script (memberentry.pl) uses
    the only occurrence of CGI::popup_menu
    Let's remove it and build the dropdown list in the template.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Empty BorrowersTitles, edit a patron and confirm that the "Salutation"
    does not appear
    2/ Fill BorrowersTitles with "Mr|Mrs|Miss|Ms", edit a patron and confirm
    that the "Salutation" dropdown list is correctly filled.
    The default option should be selected if you are editing a patron with a
    title defined.
    This should also be tested at the OPAC.
    
    Followed test pan, works as expected in Staff and OPAC

    Bug 15451: (followup) fix filename extension for csv file
    
    This patch does the same as basket/downloadcart.pl
    to set '.csv' as filename extension for downloadshelf.pl
    
    To test:
    1) Define a CSV MARC profile
    2) On staff download a list, extension is '.NN'
    with 'NN' the CSV profile id.
    3) Apply the patch
    4) Download again, check extension is now '.csv'

    Bug 15451: Do not considered a Resultset as a Result
    
    The previous calls were wrong, but there is something bad with the DB
    structure: export_format.profile should be a unique key.
    This patch fixes the previous calls and add a FIXME not to forget to fix
    the DB structure.

    Bug 15451: Koha::CsvProfiles - Remove GetCsvProfileId
    
    This subroutine returned the export_format_id for a given profile name.

    Bug 15451: Rewrite the csv profile tool script
    
    This page was inconsistent with the other admin and tool pages.
    The 2 tabs 'New profile' and 'Edit existing profile' were useless, the
    ergonomic needs to be revisited.
    This patch applies the same script/page structure as others: by default
    a table containing all csv profiles is displayed with 2 action links:
    edit and delete.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Create 1+ CSV profiles, with different types (marc and sql)
    2/ Update some values using the Edit link
    3/ Delete a CSV profile

    Bug 16934 - Cannot add notes to canceled and deleted order line
    
    Some librarians would like to be able to add notes to deleted order
    lines to keep track of data such as what title the order line was for.
    For some reason ModOrder dies if a biblionumber is passed in, even
    though it does not use biblionumber and does not need it to exist in any
    fashion! This limitation should be removed.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Create a basket with an orderline
    2) Cancel the order / delete the record
    3) Click the "Add internal note" link for that order line
    4) Fill in a note and click "Save"
    5) Note the error
    6) Apply this patch
    7) Repeat steps 3-4
    8) Note this time the note is saved!

    Bug 16909: Koha::Patrons - Remove checkuniquemember
    
    C4::Members::checkuniquemember was not really nicely written, was only
    used once and was not covered by tests.
    I think it does not make sense to keep such complexity and have this
    code in the subroutine/method.
    Looking at this patch it seems that what this subroutine did can be done
    easily in the pl script in few lines.
    
    Test plan:
    1/ Create 2 organisations with the same "surname": you should get a
    warning.
    2/ Create 2 patrons (non-organisation) with the same

    Bug 16889: Add Koha::Objects->columns
    
    Currently we have 3 subroutines to retrieve the columns of tables:
    C4::Members::columns, C4::Items::columns and
    C4::Items::biblioitems_columns.
    It is easier to have a Koha::Objects->columns method to provide the
    different classes to retrieve their related column names.

    Bug 16876: Remove Full Heading column from OPAC Auth search results
    
    To test:
    
    1) Go to Authority Search and do a search
    2) Notice that there is a Full Heading column that has 'View full
       heading' links. These take up a lot of space and don't mean a lot to
       the user
    3) Apply patch and refresh
    4) Notice that the the Full Heading column is gone and there is now a
       Details column next to the authorities. Confirm the link takes you to
       the expected authority detail page.

    Bug 16538: Improve the style of progress bars
    
    This patch updates the style of progress bars to make them a little
    nicer. Progress bars in the staff client are not built in a consisten
    way. Some have been updated to use the <progress> element and some have
    not. This patch improves some styling common to both kinds.
    
    Other changes:
    
    - Redundant in-page CSS has been removed from many pages.
    - An invalid "min" attribute has been removed from several instances of
      <progress>.
    - Corrected capitalization.
    - Fixed incorrectly quoted attributes.
    - Added missing form "action" attributes.
    
    To test, clear your browser cache if necessary. Apply the patch and
    test uploads on the following pages:
    
    - Circulation -> Offline circulation file upload
    - Tools -> Batch item modification
    - Tools -> Batch record modification
    - Tools -> Stage MARC records for import
    - Tools -> Manage staged MARC records
    - Tools -> Upload local cover image
    - Tools -> Upload
    
    In all cases, progress bars should look improved and work correctly.
    
    Test Tools -> Batch item deletion. Unused background job handling markup
    has been removed. Deletion processing should work correctly.

    Bug 16897 - Re-focus on "Add item" in Lists
    
    Bug 11325 add solved a focus on "Add item" missing in Lists page.
    Since revamping of this page, the add item form exists both in page.
    The one corrected by Bug 11325 is not visible because it checks a bad
    var allowaddingitem instead of can_add_biblios.
    
    This patch removes the first form and corrects the second form.
    It moves the form at left part of page so that it is always shown
    (usefull when there are a lot of items). It does not add the list name
    after "Add item" besause it whould be huggly for long names and because
    listname already exists in breadscrumbs and on top of the table.
    It also adds autocomplete="off" on barcode input because there can be
    problems with a scanning device.
    
    Test instructions:
    1. Create a list
    2. Make sure you have an object with an assigned barcode
    3. Go to the list
       => The barcode entry interface should be at left and has the focus
    4. Enter the barcode and press enter (or use a scanner)
       => The item is added to the list

    Bug 16893: Missing closing tag disrupts patron detail page style
    
    A missing closing </i> causes the the patron detail page to be in all
    italics if the patron has a restriction message. This patch corrects it.
    
    To test, apply the patch and locate a patron who has a restriction
    message. The restriction message should be in italics but the rest of
    the page should display normally.

    Bug 14138: Patroncard: Warn user if PDF creation fails
    
    Change patroncards/create-pdf.pl to redirect with an error message
    instead of writing an invalid pdf that does not open in pdf viewer.
    
    To test:
    - Apply patch
    
    - Test that pdf creator behaves as before (with valid batches and
      patron lists)
    
    - While testing, copy pdf link address from window with title 'Click
      the following link(s) to download...'
    
    - Open another staff client browser tab
    
    - Paste link to browser address field, change batch id rsp. patron
      list id to an invalid value and submit
    
    - The window should redirect to cgi-bin/koha/patroncards/create-pdf.pl
      and display an error message
    
    - Bonus test 1: Create an empty patron list and test patron card
      creation. You should get an error message as appropriate.
    
    - Bonus test 2: Use a link with params like the following:
      ...create-pdf.pl?borrower_number=61&template_id=2&layout_id=1&start_card=1
      Verify that you can create a pdf with a valid borrower_number and that
      you get the error message with an invalid borrower number

    Bug 15006: [QA Follow-up] Only handle login requests in raw_transport
    
    Although mainly hypothetical, it would still be possible to get
    response from the server for an acs resend request. (This exception
    is allowed in MsgType::handle.)
    I also noticed that the response may well be a message from an older
    session still.
    This patch just removes that exception by only passing login requests
    to sub handle in the raw_transport loop.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Verify normal login procedure for raw.
    [2] Check a few acs resend requests in raw. They should terminate without
        a response.

    Bug 15006: Centralize timeout logic and allow zero client timeout
    
    Moving timeout logic to one routine (with unit test).
    
    This further implements two suggestions from Kyle and Larry:
    
    [1] You could use a client_timeout of 0 to specify no timeout at all.
    [2] Have the client_timeout default to the timeout if not defined.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Run t/db_dependent/SIP/SIPServer.t.
    [2] Test login timeout for raw and telnet.
    [3] Check ACS status message for timeout value. Should match policy
        timeout from institution.
    [4] Test client timeout (zero and non-zero).
    [5] Remove client timeout. Test fallback to service.
    [6] Remove service timeout too. Test fallback to 30 at login.

    Bug 15006: Introduce client_timeout in SIPconfig.xml
    
    Most selfchecks have persistent connections and send a
    periodic status request at intervals (approx every 5mins appears
    the norm) The timeout was dropping connections by default every 30secs
    which for the client appears as a very flakey network.
    
    This patch adds a separate parameter client_timeout that can be
    used if you do want to force a disconnect if the client sends
    no requests for a period. The sample config sets it to 600, but you
    can also define a 0 value meaning no timeout. If the parameter is not
    defined, it will fallback to service timeout.
    
    Signed-off-by: Marcel de Rooy <m.de.rooy@rijksmuseum.nl>
    Restored this patch from Colin in order to separate it from the
    get_timeout patch. Adjusted the commit message slightly.
    The original value of 600 from Colin's earlier patch may give less
    discussion than setting to 0 (no timeout) in a later proposal.

    Bug 15006 Drop raw connection if login fails
    
    raw_connection was not behaving correctly if an invalid string was
    passed or a login failed.
    It was not checking that the login succeeded ( it checked that account
    existed not that it contained data and it existed even if login failed)
    and so failed logins instead of aborting immediately fell through into
    the sip_protocol_loop, forcing that to timeout invalid connections.
    It now checks that account has id set and returns if not.
    
    The timeout alarm is now set on the while loop, in normal running this
    should not be triggered as the socket is opened and the first data
    should be a login message and the while loop should only iterate once,
    but lets not go into an infinite loop due to unforeseen circumstances.
    
    I have reindented the routine as the flow was not clear (the while was
    not indented at all.
    
    Also if using Net::Server::PreFork when a new connection comes in you
    may be handed the the successful login parameters from a preceding call.
    Because of this you could successfully transmit transactions and Koha
    would carry them out without having received a valid login ( and
    possibly with the wrong account details!) We now delete any existing
    account for new connections.

    data structures (like MARC framework hash-of-hashes-of-hashes returned
    by GetMarcStructure() ), deep-cloning is currently sub-optimal;
    this patch addresses that particular issue. It also provides an
    ability to intermix "safe" and "unsafe" cache feches, in such
    way that they don't interfere with each other (i.e., eliminating
    the risk involved with "unsafe" calls possibly compromising
    further "safe" calls).
    
    Test plan:
    
    1) apply patch
    2) flush L2 cache if necessary (restart memcached daemon)
    3) profile GetMarcStructure() calls before / after patch, e.g. by
    running some script which calls it often (like catalogue search
    w/ XSLT processing turned on, etc.) - GetMarcStructure() should be
    faster than before, in all possible circumstances (eg. 18 msec
    per call -> 10 msec p/call)
    4) after testing, before returning to the master branch, flush L2 cache
    again (restart memcached daemon) - otherwise all system preferences
    returned from L2 cache would be suffixed with '-CF0'

    Bug 13691: Add basic selenium script
    
    This script has been used to compare 3.16.x and 3.18.x performances on
    bug 13690.
    
    What it does:
    - Go on the mainpage and process a log in
    - Create a patron category
    - Create a patron
    - Add 3 items
    - check the 3 items out to the patron
    - check the 3 items in
    
    How to use it?
    
    $ wget https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.53/selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar
    
    $ vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/firefox.list

    Bug 13807 Rework main input loop in SIPServer
    
    Debugging various problems in SIPServer and control of it, found it
    could loop on unread buffers (e.g. the LF of a CRLF if it was only
    expecting CR) making it unresponsive to signals.
    Reworked the input loop with an eye to removing unnecessary whiles
    and replacing the while(1) by a while( connection valid)
    Enhanced the timeout code by wapping in an eval.
    Moved the logic from SIP_read_packet into the server itself
    Hopefully this makes the already baroque code easier to navigate
    and it did seem the server was the logical place for this
    Removed no longer iused SIP_read_packet from Sip.pm

    Bug 16778: Replace usage of Greybox modals with Bootstrap modals
    
    This patch is a proof-of-concept for replacing Greybox modals in
    situations where in-modal page transitions happen. This one addresses
    patron card export from the patron lists page.
    
    To test you must have at least one patron lists containing patrons.
    
    - Apply the patch and go to Patrons -> Patron lists.
    - In the 'Actions' menu associated with your list, choose 'Print patron
      cards.' A modal window should be triggered.
    - In the modal window, change settings as necessary and click the
      "Export" button.
    - The modal should reload and display a link to download a PDF. Confirm
      that the PDF download works correctly and that the correct patron
      batch was processed.
    - Repeat the process and confirm at each step that clicking the 'X'
      button or the 'Cancel' link dismisses the modal window.
    
    To confirm that changes to the patron card print template has not
    adversely affected printing patron cards from the patron card creator
    page:
    
    - Go to Tools -> Patron card creator.
    - Choose Manage -> Card batches.
    - Click 'Export' for any batch.
    - Confirm that the Greybox modal still works correctly for patron card
      export.

    Bug 16677 - Use abbr for authorities linked headings
    
    In authorities search results, UNIMARC flavour, linked headings are displayed
    with a link type : BT, NT, UF, RT.
    
    This patch adds a abbr tag around those acronyms to know there meaning :
    BT = Broader Term
    NT = Narrower Term
    UF = Used For
    RT = Related Term
    
    Acronyms are used because there can be a lot of linked headings, using abbr
    will display the complete text on mouse over.
    
    Test plan :
    
    - Use UNIMARC database
    - Create an authority with :
    250 $a Heading250a
    450 $a Heading450a
    550 $5 a $a Heading550a
    550 $5 g $a Heading550g
    550 $5 h $a Heading550h
    - Save an index zebraqueue
    - Go to intranet authorities search
    - Search for "Heading250a"
    - You see :
    Heading250a
    Heading250a
    UF: Heading450a
    RT: Heading550a ; BT: Heading550g ; NT: Heading550h
    - Move your mouse over the acronyms, you see a tip with the complete text

    Bug 16566 [Revised] 'Print slip' button formatting inconsistent
    
    This patch modifies the style of some "print slip" links on the checkin
    page to make them consistent with other buttons shown in dialogs.
    
    This patch also removes the use of "onclick" in some places in favor of
    defining events in the JavaScript.
    
    To test apply the patch and go to Circulation -> Check in.
    
    - Check in an item which belongs at another branch. You should see a
      dialog which asks the user to transfer the item. Confirm that the
      "Print slip" button looks correct and works correctly.
    
    - Check in the same item again. You should see a different dialog which
      has both a "Print transfer slip" and "Cancel transfer" button. The
      "Print transfer slip" button should look correct and work correctly.
    
    - Check in an item which is part of a rotating collection. (Or, if Bug
      16570 is still open, check in any item) You should see a dialog which
      notifies you that the item is part of a rotating collection. The
      "Print slip" button in this dialog should look correct and work
      correctly.
    
    Followed test plan. Buttons appear as expected.

    If limit is X and patrons has X-1 pending suggestions, when a new one is
    added, the "New suggestion" should not been added.
    to avoid another call to SearchSuggestions, we assume than the
    suggestion has been correctly added.

    This works fine except that it doesn't open in a new tab. I don't think
    it's the fault of the patch, but of browser.js messing with links again

    Bug 14757 - Allow the use of Template Toolkit syntax for slips and notices
    
    This bug is the beginning of a conversion from our current bespoke
    syntax for slips and notices to Template Toolkit syntax.
    
    This patch is the initial seed which will evolve over time.
    With this addition, we can take advantage of our Koha Objects
    to greatly simplify the processing of Slips and Notices over time.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Apply this patch
    2) Ensure you have the default CHECKOUT notice
    3) Check out and return an item for a patron
    4) Note the text of the CHECKOUT notice
    5) Replace your CHECKOUT notice with the following:
    
    The following items have been checked out:
    ----
    [% biblio.title %]
    ----
    Thank you for visiting [% branch.branchname %].
    
    6) Repeat step 3
    7) Note the CHECKOUT notice text matches the previous CHECKOUT notice text

    Bug 9259: Ability to delete a staged file once it has been cleaned
    
    To test:
    1) Go to Tools -> Staged MARC Management and clean a file. If you have no files to clean, go to 'Stage MARC for import' and upload one to clean following the necessary steps.
    2) Confirm that once the file has been cleaned, the Action column now shows a Delete button. Confirm this button only shows for cleaned files.
    3) Click the Delete button.
    4) Confirm that clicking Cancel exits the pop-up message and does not delete the file.
    5) Confirm that clicking OK refreshes the list of staged records and the one you just deleted is no longer on it (has been deleted). You can confirm this by checking for the file in mysql (SELECT * FROM import_batches WHERE import_batch_id = X;)
    6) Run prove -v t/db_dependent/ImportBatch.t (have written unit tests for CleanBatch and DeleteBatch)

    Bug 6906 - show 'Borrower has previously issued...
    
    New feature: provide granular means to configure warnings about items
    that have been issued to a particular borrower before, according to
    their checkout history.
    
    - Global syspref ('CheckPrevCheckout'), set to 'hardno' by default,
      allows users to enable this feature library wide.
    - Per patron category pref allows libraries to create overrides per
      category, falling back on the global setting by default.
    - Per patron pref allows switching the functionality on at the level
      of patron. Fall-back to category settings by default.
    
    * Koha/Patron (wantsCheckPrevCheckout, doCheckPrevCheckout): New
      methods.
    * C4/Circulation.pm (CanBookBeIssued): Introduce CheckPrevCheckout
      check.
    * admin/categories.pl: Pass along checkprevcheckout.
    * koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/admin/categories.tt: Expose
      CheckPrevCheckout per category setting.
    * koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/preferences/patrons.pref:
      Expose CheckPrevCheckout syspref.
    * koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/members/memberentrygen.tt:
      Expose per patron CheckPrevCheckout preference.
    * koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/members/moremember.tt: Expose
      per patron CheckPrevCheckout preference.
    * koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/modules/circ/circulation.tt: Add
      'CHECKPREVCHECKOUT' confirmation message.
    * installer/data/mysql/kohastructure.sql: Modify structure of
      'categories', 'borrowers', 'oldborrowers'.
    * installer/data/mysql/sysprefs.sql: Add 'CheckPrevCheckout'.
    * installer/data/mysql/atomicupdate/checkPrevCheckout.sql: New file.
    * t/db_dependent/Patron/CheckPrevCheckout.t: New file with unit tests.
    
    Test plan:
    - Apply patch.
    - Run updatedatabase.
    - Regenerate Koha Schema files.
    - Run the unit tests.
    - Verify 'CheckPrevCheckout' is visible in Patrons sysprefs and can be
      switched to 'hardyes', 'softyes', 'softno' and 'hardno'.
      + Check out previously checked out items to a patron, checking the
        message appears as expected.
    - Verify no 'Check previous checkouts' setting appears on the borrower
      category pages if the syspref is set to a 'hard' option.
    - Verify 'Check previous checkouts' setting appears on the borrower
      category pages and can be modified per borrower category.
      + Issue previously issued items to a borrower, checking the message
        appears as expected (This setting should override the default
        setting if that is set to a 'soft' option).
    - Verify no 'Check previous checkouts' setting appears on the individual
      borrower pages if the syspref is set to a 'hard' option.
    - Verify 'Check previous checkouts' setting appears on individual
      borrower pages and can be modified.
      + Issue previously issued items to a borrower, checking the message
        appears as expected (This setting should override the category
        setting and the default setting if the latter is set to a 'soft'
        option).
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 16859: Fix wrong item field name in export.pl
    
    Field callnumber should be itemcallnumber.
    For completeness, prefixing the joined fields with items table prefix.
    
    Note: You should expect Tools/Export to export only the items within a
    given itemcallnumber range, but if the biblio has one item in that
    range, the biblionumber is selected for export with ALL items. The script
    is designed that way (first select biblio numbers based on criteria, and
    run export with those biblio numbers).
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Select a biblio N with one item with say itemcallnumber X.
    [2] Goto Tools/Export. Select biblio range N,N and no itemcallnumber
        range. The biblio should be exported.
    [3] Select biblio range N,N and itemcallnumber range A,B. No output.
    [4] Select biblio range N,N and itemcallnumber range A,<empty>. Output.
    [5] Select biblio range N,N and itemcallnumber range <empty>,X. Output.

    Bug 16780 - Specify due date always sets time as AM when using 12 hour time format
    
    This regression is occurs because the time format for the checkout
    date/time widget is only meant to be given in 24 hour format. The time
    due should not be converted to 12 hr time even if the library has 12
    hour set as their preferred time format.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Performat a backdated checkout with a date due that has a PM time
    2) Note the date/time picker on the confirmition screen shows the time
       in AM/PM
    2) Note the time is not stored correctly
    3) Apply this patch
    4) Repeate step 1
    5) Note the confirmation date/time picker now show the time in 24hr
       format

    Bug 16762: Record matching rules: Remove match check link removes too much
    
    My patch for Bug 5006 introduced a lot of markup changes to the record
    matching rules template. I missed a change in one are though, which
    caused a bug with the way the 'Remove match check' link works.
    
    To reproduce:
    
    - Go to Administration -> Record matching rules.
    - Edit a matching rule which includes at least one match check.
    - Click a 'Remove match check' link. The entire "Required match checks"
      block is removed.
    
    To test, apply the patch and repeat the steps above. Clicking any
    'Remove match check' link should remove only the corresponding rule.

    Bug 16760: fix Circulation Statistics wizard under Plack
    
    This patch fixes some variable scoping problems when running
    the circulation statistics wizard under Plack.  For example,
    when using the item type as a row header, with this patch the
    item type description is displayed rather than "UKNOWN VALUE".
    
    This patch also enables warnings and fixes a couple variable
    initialization issues. (Note that turning on warnings across
    the board would make it easier to identify Plack variable scoping
    issues, as "Variable "$foo" is not available at' errors would
    be recorded in the Plack error log).
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Run the staff interface under Plack.
    [2] Go to the Circulation Statistics Wizard and run a report
        using item type as the row. Note that the row labels
        display as "UNKNOWN VALUE" rather than the item type.
    [3] Apply the patch and restart Plack.
    [4] Run step #2 again; this time, the item type descriptions should
        be used as the row labels.

    Note that I am not sure catalogue is the correct permission, but it's
    the one used almost everywhere in this module

    Bug 16431: Use Koha::Cache to cache marc subfield structure
    
    The marc subfield structure is currently cached using a global variable
    of C4::Context. The infos are retrieved every time a new context is
    created.
    This patch suggests to use Koha::Cache instead.
    
    To achieve this goal, a new subroutine is created
    C4::Biblio::GetMarcSubfieldStructure, it will be called from code which
    needs to get the marc subfield structure. GetMarcFromKohaField,
    GetMarcSubfieldStructureFromKohaField, TransformKohaToMarc and
    _get_inverted_marc_field_map are modified accordingly and the cache is cleared
    when the table is updated (from the 3 pl scripts modified by this patch).
    
    The caching done in C4::Context (marcfromkohafield) is removed.
    
    Test plan:
    Play with the marc subfield structure (in the administration module),
    then add and edit records and make sure everything went fine.

    Changes the value of the "comment" column in "borrower_debarments" table
    from "Restriction added by overdues process yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" to
    "OVERDUE_PROCESS yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" in the overdue_notices.pl. Then in
    the templates "moremember.tt", "circulation.tt", "memberentrygen.tt",
    "opac-reserve.tt" and "opac-user.tt" the value of "comment" is
    check, if it's an automatical comment due to overdue process it'll
    write "Restriction added by overdues process yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss",
    then if there is a customizable comment it will be written without
    modification. Like this, the comment "Restriction added by overdues
    process" is written in the po files and can be translated later.
    
    To test:
    1) create a patron with automatical restriction due to overdue process;
    2) apply patch;
    3) run misc/cronjobs/overdue_notices.pl;
    4) verify if the comment "Restriction added by overdues process" is well
       written and translatable on the following page :
        - opac patron home page (opac-user.tt);
        - opac item reservation page (opac-reserve.tt);
        - pro patron page (moremember.tt);
        - reservation item for a patron (circulation.tt, memberentrygen.tt);
    5) try to translate the comment in po files;
    6) sign off.

    Bug 3534 - Patron quick add form
    
    This patch adds a new system preference:
        PatronQuickAddFields
    
    When either this pref or BorrowerMandatoryField is populated this will add a new dropdown to the bew patron toolbar.
    When a category is chosen from this dropdown the fields in PatronQuickAddFields and BorrowerMandatoryField will be displayed.
    There will be a button allowing a user to switch from the quickadd to the full form and fields will be copied between the forms when toggling.
    
    The Quick add will only be displayed on add of a new patron, future edits should display the full form.
    
    Test plan:
     1 - Apply patch
     2 - run updatedatabase.pl
     3 - Add a new patron and ensure nothing has changed
     4 - Populate either PatronQuickAddFields or BorrowerMandatory fields
     and note the new button for adding a patron
     5 - Click the Quick add and choose a type
     6 - Only required or quick add fields should be displayed
     7 - Verify toggling forms copies information
     8 - Ensure you cannot save patron without filling required fields
     (quick add fields should be optional)
     9 - Ensure you can save patron with fields filled out
    10 - Ensure that a duplicate patron brings up the duplicate/add new
    buttons with full form displayed
    11 - Verify that subsequent edits use only full form
    12 - Verify that data on form submitted is the data saved to patron
    13 - Test with various values in both MandatoryBorrowerFields and PatronQuickAddFields

    This patch answers Jonathan's request to simplify this patchset a bit.
    
    It removes the need for the .sql file, as _default_rule now defaults to
    a fixed value (1, which was set by the removed .sql file).
    This allowed to remove the overloaded ->delete method.
    
    The tests have been adjusted to reflect this changes, including tests for
    the new 'default'-if-absent situation.

    Bug 14048: (followup) Use the original holding branch
    
    This patch picks the item's holding branch *before* it gets fixed
    by using the checkin library instead. This way the RefundLostOnReturnControl
    syspref set to ItemHoldingBranch is respected (otherwise, as Nick explained
    this behaves just like if CheckinLibrary was set)

    Bug 14048: Add a refund rules setting form in smart-rules
    
    This patch introduces the CRUD UI for managing the refund lost item fee
    rules on the general 'Circulation and fines rules' page.
    
    Verify that rules can be added and changed.
    
    Rules are correctly associated to the chosen branch (or the
    general default rule).
    
    To test:
    - Apply the patch
    - Open smart-rules.pl
    => SUCCESS: The text and refund rules section correctly refers to default global rules.
       The policy can be set to Yes and No, and works as expected.
    - Pick a specific branch
    => SUCCESS: The rule refers to the specific branch
    => SUCCESS: It detects the default rule is picked
    => SUCCESS: On changing the rules values are correctly retrieved if entering
       again to the page.
    => SUCCESS: The 'Use default' text is suffixed with the correct value set by the user
       in the 'All libraries' scenario.
    => Sign off :-D

    This patch introduces new classes for handling refund lost item fee
    rules. It introduces a new table for storing this rules.
    
    It is designed so it is possible to define a global rule, and then
    branch-specific ones. The specific is prefered if available.
    
    This behaviour is fully tested by unit tests introduced by the following patches.
    
    This cannot be tested on its own.

    Bug 16602 - Remove the use of "onclick" from several templates
    
    This patch removes the use of "onclick" from several templates, instead
    defining click events in JavaScript.
    
    Also changed: Some markup corrections.
    
    To test, apply the patch and:
    
    - Go to Circulation -> Upload offline circulation file
      - Browse for an offline circulation file.
      - Clicking the 'Upload file' button should work correctly.
        - After uploading a file, both the 'Add to offline circulation
          queue' and 'Apply directly' buttons should work to trigger their
          corresponding processes (keeping Bug 16603 in mind).
    
    - Go to Patrons -> Patron lists.
      - For any patron list containing patrons, click the 'Print patron
        cards' menu item. This should trigger a modal window which exports
        the correct list.
    
    - Go to Tools -> Batch item modification.
      - Submit a batch of items for modification.
      - Clicking the 'Save' button should trigger the background job and the
        items should be successfully modified.
    
    - Go to Tools -> Batch item deletion.
      - Submit a batch of items for deletion.
      - Clicking the 'Delete' button should trigger the background job and
        the items should be successfully deleted.
    
    - Go to Tools -> Calendar.
      - Trigger the 'Add new holiday' panel by clicking a day on the
        calendar which has no holiday defined.
      - Clicking the 'Cancel' link should hide the panel.
      - Trigger the 'Edit this holiday' panel by clicking a day which has a
        holiday defined.
      - Clicking the 'Cancel' link should hide the panel.

    Bug 16557 - Remove the use of "onclick" from several include files
    
    This patch modifies several include files, removing "onclick" attributes
    in favor of defining events in JavaScript.
    
    A reusable "toggle" function has been added to the global JS file so
    that clicking elements with the class "toggle_element" will toggle the
    display of elements as defined in the click target's "data-element"
    attribute.
    
    Also changed: In subtypes_unimarc.inc some capitalization errors have
    been fixed and label/id pairs corrected.
    
    To test, apply the patch and clear your browser cache if necessary.
    
    - On the Acquisitions home page, click the "Orders search" header search
      tab. Clicking the [+] link should expand and collapse the additional
      search fields.
    
    - On the checkout or patron detail page, view the "Restrictions" tab.
      Click to add a restriction and use the datepicker to select a date.
      Clicking the "Clear date" link should clear the date.
    
    - Trigger the help window on any page. Clicking the "close window"
      button should work correctly.
    
    - Go to Administration -> Patron categories -> Edit. Checking and
      unchecking messaging preference options should work correctly. The "do
      not notify" checkbox should clear other checkboxes in that row and
      vice versa.
    
    - In Serials, from a subscription detail page, clicking the "Renew"
      button should trigger the renew popup.
    
    - Go to Acquisitions -> Vendor -> Add to basket -> From a subscription.
      Clicking the "Advanced search" link in the left hand sidebar should
      toggle the sidebar search form.
    
    - In a UNIMARC system, view the advanced search page. Clicking the "Show
      coded information filters" link should show additional search fields.
      (I tested in my MARC21 system by temporarily moving line 174 of
      advsearch.tt to line 172).

    Bug 16549 - Remove the use of "onclick" from header search forms
    
    This patch removes the use of "onclick" from all header search forms for
    the purpose of triggering the "keep_text" function. This behavior is now
    handled in the globally-included JS file.
    
    To test, apply the patch and clear your cache if necessary.
    
    - Enter text in any header search form field. Click to each other tab
      in the header and confirm that your text is copied to each.
    - Test the behavior of the header search form on at least one page where
      each is included:
    
      - The staff client home page
      - The advanced search page
      - The authorities home page
      - The administration home page
      - The cataloging home page
      - The checkin page
      - The circulation home page
      - The patrons home page
      - Acquisitions -> Vendor -> Contracts
      - Administration -> Cities
      - Administration -> Currencies and exchange rates
      - Administration -> Patron categories
      - Administration -> Printers (why is this page still around?)
      - Administration -> System preferences
      - Administration -> Z39.50/SRU servers
      - Tools -> Notices & slips
    
    This patch modifies does not fix the existing (unreported) bug which
    prevents the keep text function from working in the include file used on
    these pages:
    
      - Acquisitions -> Vendor -> Basket -> New order from suggestion
      - Administration -> Budgets
      - The serials home page

    Bug 16513 - Improvements and fixes for quote upload process
    
    This patch fixes some minor bugs and adds a small enhancement to the
    quotes editor and quotes upload pages.
    
    To test, apply the patch and go to Tools -> Quote editor
    
    - In the table of quotes, clicking the "ID" table header should trigger
      an alert, "Click on the quote's ide to select..."
    - Go to "Import quotes" and select a file to upload.
    - On the upload preview page you should see a new "Cancel import"
      button. Clicking it should return you to the quotes upload page after
      asking for confirmation.
    - Test the upload cancel button:
      - If you have fast reflexes or are uploading a file large enough, you
        should be able to see a "Cancel upload" button during the upload
        process.
      - Clicking this button should cancel the upload and return you to the
        quote upload page.
    
    Tested on top of Bug 16589, works as expected.

    Bug 16494 - Remove the use of "onclick" from some patron pages
    
    This patch removes the use of "onclick" attributes from some patron
    pages.
    
    To test, apply the patch and:
    
    - In Patrons, perform any search which will return multiple results.
      Confirm that the "select all" and "clear all" links work as expected.
      Font Awesome icons have been added to these links.
    
      In the left-hand sidebar, change any of the filters and click the
      "Clear" button. The form (and your search results) should reset.
    
    - Open the 'Set permissions' page for any patron. Checking any
      permission with sub-permissions should correctly expand the tree and
      select all sub-permissions. The reverse should also work.
    
      Also changed in this file: The "Inconsistency detected" alert has been
      reformatted to make it translatable.
    
    - View the detail page for a patron with one or more restrictions.
      Clicking the "View restrictions" link at the top of the page should
      jump you to and activate the restrictions tab.
    
    - View the 'Notices' tab for a patron who has been sent one or more
      notices. Click any notice title to expand the notice. Clicking the
      "resend" button should resend the notice.
    
    - Create a new patron with the same first and last name as an existing
      patron. This should trigger a duplicate warning message. Click the
      "View existing record" link to trigger a pop-up window with a patron
      detail brief view.
    
      In this window an "email" class has been added to the primary and
      secondary email lines so that long email addresses don't overlap the
      second column of data.
    
      Confirm that clicking the "close" button in this window closes the
      window. The changes to staff-global.css are included in this patch to
      prevent the close button from having an incorrect color change on
      hover.

    Bug 16490 - Add an "add to cart" link for each search results in the staff client
    
    This patch adds an "add to cart" link to each line of search results in
    the staff client.
    
    To test, apply the patch and clear your browser cache if necessary.
    
    - Enable the intranetbookbag system preference.
    - Perform a search which will return multiple search results.
    - Each result should have an "Add to cart" link.
      - Clicking the "Add to cart" link should add the title to the cart,
        triggering the correct pop-up message and changing the link to read
        "In your cart (remove)."
      - Clicking the "remove" link should remove the title from your cart
        and trigger the correct messages.
    - Add multiple titles to your cart and perform the same search again.
      Each result should correctly indicate which titles are already in your
      cart.
    - Open the cart popup window.
      - Check the checkbox for one or more titles in your cart and choose
        "Remove." The titles should be removed, and the "In your cart" label
        in the search results page should reflect that the titles are no
        longer in the cart.
      - Choose "Empty and close." All titles in the parent page should now
        indicate that they are not in the cart.
    - Disable the intranetbookbag preference and confirm that the "Add to
      cart" links are no longer there.
    
    Followed test plan. Works as expected.

    Bug 16477 - Improve staff client cart JavaScript and template
    
    This patch makes several changes to the cart JavaScript and template. In
    the template:
    
    - Remove "onclick" attributes in favor of defining events in the
      JavaScript.
    - Add a [% BLOCK %] section for some repeated markup.
    - Add some Font Awesome icons (I didn't add icons to all controls
      because I thought it looked cluttered).
    - Move the batch modification control out of the toolbar and into the
      group of controls which affects selected records. I think this is a
      logical grouping, and makes more sense than having a drop-down menu in
      the toolbar with a single menu item.
    
    JavaScript:
    
    - Created separate "cart.js" file so that JS could be moved out of the
      template without loading up basket.js with event functions which are
      not needed on every page in the staff client.
    - Fix JSHint errors.
    
    To test, apply the patch and clear your browser cache if necessary.
    
    - Add multiple items to the cart in the staff client and open the cart.
    - Confirm correct functionality of these toolbar buttons:
      - "More details" (and the corresponding "Show less")
      - "Send"
      - "Print"
      - "Empty and close"
    - Confirm the correct functionality of all the selection controls:
      Select all, clear all, Remove, Add to a list, Place hold, Batch
      modify, and Batch delete.
    - Confirm that clicking any title in the cart opens the correct detail
      page in the parent window.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 16469 - Remove the use of "onclick" from some catalog pages
    
    This patch removes the use of "onclick" attributes from two
    catalog-related templates: The local cover image viewer and the search
    results page. Events are now defined in JavaScript.
    
    To test:
    
    On the search results page:
    
    - Perform a catalog search which will return multiple results.
    - On the search results page, confirm that the "Select all" and "Clear
      all" links at the top of the results table work correctly.
    
    In the local cover image viewer:
    
    - The LocalCoverImages and AllowMultipleCovers system preferences must
      enabled, and at least one catalog record must have at least two local
      cover images attached.
    - Locate that record in the catalog and view the detail page for it.
    - Click the cover image in the "Images" tab to go to the image viewer
      page.
    - Clicking each local cover image thumnail should correctly display the
      larger version of each image.

    In order to make it work, this patch adds some changes to the plugin to
    add the ability to define our own offset.
    When the div is extended (+, filteraction_on), the offset should be
    updated to move the toolbar. Same when the div is folded (-,
    filteraction_off)

    Bug 15485: (QA followup) Simplify logic and use *ResultsDisplay value during upgrade
    
    This patch makes the new sysprefs work as the previously defined. Instead of falling back
    to what *ResultsDisplay is set, it now has its own 'default' (that still defaults to the
    *Results*.xslt).
    
    The default values are set to 'default' as the rest of XSLT-related sysprefs, and the upgrade
    picks whatever is set in OPACXSLTResultsDisplay and XSLTResultsDisplay so current behaviour
    is preserved.

    Bug 15485: (QA followup) Fix behaviour and default values
    
    Jonathan noticed the current behaviour is that the lists rendering
    falls back to the XSLTResults, and if not defined (i.e. != 'default' and
    != some_path) it falls back to a legacy display (non-XSLT).
    
    The patchset changed this behaviour because 'default' is not a valid value
    for the lists. So it should fallback to the current behaivour (i.e. Results
    XSLT configuration) if not defined. This patch fixes this by adding
     || C4::Context->preference('XSLTResultsDisplay')
    (and the OPAC counterpart).
    
    It also fixes minor glitches on the update message (oops) and bad default value
    in sysprefs.sql  for 'XSLTListsDisplay'.
    
    Thanks Jonathan!

    Bug 15485: Use lists-specific XSLT sysprefs
    
    This patch makes the shelves.pl (staff) and opac-shelves.pl scripts
    use the new sysprefs for specifying custom XSLTs for lists display.
    
    XSLT.pm is patched so it defaults to the corresponding *Results.xsl
    files if none is specified.
    
    To test:
    - Create a list
    - Open the list in the staff interface
    - On a new tab, open the list in the OPAC.
    - Apply this patches
    === default behaviour
    - Open the list (both opac and staff) on new tabs
    => SUCCESS: They look exactly the same (hint: the syspref is set to ''
       so it should fallback to using the one we were using.
    === using the new functionality
    - Create custom XSLTs for lists, for example:
      $ cd /home/vagrant/kohaclone/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/en/xslt
      $ cp MARC21slim2OPACResults.xsl MARC21slim2OPACLists.xsl
    - Edit your sysprefs, setting OPACXSLTListsDisplay to:
      /home/vagrant/kohaclone/koha-tmpl/opac-tmpl/bootstrap/{langcode}/xslt/MARC21slim2OPACLists.xsl
    - Reload the OPAC list view
    => SUCCESS: Looks exactly as before
    - Make some minor tweak (for example in line 423 replace
      <xsl:text> </xsl:text>
    for
      <xsl:text> BLAH </xsl:text>
    - Reload the list
    => SUCCESS: BLAH shows in several places on the title.
    - Repeat for the staff interface
    - Sign off :-D
    
    So we can now set custom XSLTs for lists.

    Bug 15485: Introduce new sysprefs for lists XSLTs
    
    This patch introduces two new sysprefs, allowing the users to
    set custom XSLTs for lists display. This is done almost the usual
    way.
    
    If none is specified (value='') it defaults to the current behaviour:
    using the *Results.xsl file for the corresponding interface.

    Bug 3669: Moving 'Add a new message' into a pop up box and adding to patron toolbar
    
    This patch moves all the code into an include which can be accessed from the 'Add a new message' link or the patron toolbar.
    
    EDIT: Ensuring modal opens on all pages
    EDIT2: Once the form has been submitted the page will redirect to where you submitted the form from.
    EDIT3: Fixing indentation of member-add-message.inc
           Ensuring messages save on every page
           Fill branch
           Ensure predefined notes appear
           Form redirects to where it was submitted from, or just the circulation page.
    EDIT4: Removing the new include file and moving it all into the modal in the toolbar
    EDIT5: Removing swp file and unnecessary code duplication by utilising plugins
    EDIT6: Batch checkout fixes
    EDIT7: Ensure you do not get JS error from Comment 24 (Batch checkout syspref must be turned on)
    
    To test:
    1) Go to a patron circ page (circ/circulation.pl?borrowernumber=X)
    2) Click 'Add a new message' under Messages
    3) Confirm this brings up the modal to add a message. Confirm clicking Save saves your message. If it is an OPAC message (for the user), confirm it shows as expected on the OPAC.
    4) Click Cancel. Confirm this closes the modal.
    5) Click 'Add message' button in toolbar. Complete steps 3 and 4.
    6) Confirm the modal opens from all other pages with the members toolbar. Confirm predefined notes shows.
            circ/circulation.pl
            members/moremember.pl
            members/routing-lists.pl

            turn on BatchCheckouts syspref and put in appropriate patron category
            circ/circulation.pl?borrowernumber=X&batch=1
    7) Confirm that the page redirects to where you submitted the form from once you have submitted it.
    8) Go to Check Out tab and confirm your message saved (or OPAC, wherever you saved it)

    This patch is aimed to eliminate the warns.

      return multiple search results.
    - Confirm that the results are sorted by patron name.
    
    In the catalog:
    - Locate and place a hold on a title.
    - When prompted to select a patron to place the hold for, perform a

    items a librarian is allowed to modify in a batch, but on the batch
    deletion tool the pref is used to limit the number of items to display.
    
    To clarify things, this patch split the pref into 2 new prefs:
    MaxItemsToDisplayForBatchDel and MaxItemsToProcessForBatchMod.
    
    Later we could add a MaxItemsToProcessForBatchDel if needed.
    Note that this patch should not introduce any changes in the current behaviors.
    
    Test plan:
    0/ Do not execute the update DB entry
    1/ Set a value != 1000 for MaxItemsForBatch
    2/ Execute the update DB entry and confirm that the 2 new prefs are
    initially set with the value of MaxItemsForBatch and that
    MaxItemsForBatch has been deleted
    3/ Set different values for these 2 prefs (2 and 3 for instance to ease
    the next steps)
    4/ Try to delete less than MaxItemsToDisplayForBatchDel items
    => You must see the items details
    5/ Try to delete more than MaxItemsToDisplayForBatchDel items
    => You must not see the items details but are allowed to delete them
    6/ Try to modify less than MaxItemsToProcessForBatchMod items
    => You must see the items details
    7/ Try to modify more than MaxItemsToProcessForBatchMod items
    => You must be restricted and not allowed to process

    Bug 16593: Do not allow patrons to delete search history of others patrons
    
    A malicious user can delete the search history of all other users by
    correctly guessing the ID value assigned to the victim's search. As
    searches are assigned values sequentially, an attacker could quickly
    remove the searches belonging to all of the application's users.
    
    To reproduce:
    Login with patron A
    launch a search
    Note the id generated for this search history:
    select id from search_history order by id desc limit 1;
    Login with patron B
    Hit /cgi-bin/koha/opac-search-history.pl?action=delete&id=<ID>
    Note that the row is deleted in the DB
    
    Test plan
    Confirm that this patch fixes the issue.
    The same test can be made at the staff interface

    Bug 16527: Restore sticky due date behavior
    
    Bug 10067 has introduced a regression on the sticky due date behavior:
    If "remember for session" is checked and the due date is changed from 1
    checkout to another, the old due date will be used.
    
    The code added by bug 10067 is really confusing and it's hard to say
    this patch won't introduce another regression.
    The manipulation of $restoreduedatespec, $duedatespec and $stickyduedate
    is not easy to follow.

    Bug 16534: Make CanBookBeIssued test if the issue can be returned
    
    If an issue is already checked out, CanBookBeIssued must check if the
    issue can be checked in before processing the return.
    In such cases (depending of the AllowReturnToBranch pref), the issue
    should not be allowed.
    
    Prior to this patch, the checkin was not done and the checkout failed
    with "Duplicate entry '1204321' for key 'itemnumber'". Indeed since bug
    14978, there is an uniq key on issues.itemnumber. Before bug 14978 the
    issue existed but was hidden (and some weird behaviors certainly
    happened!).
    
    To avoid Koha to crash, a check is added to CanBookBeIssued (call to
    CanBookBeReturned) and the librarian is not able to process the
    checkout.
    
    Test plan:
    
    - Set AllowReturnToBranch to anywhere
    - Check an item (homebranch Library 1, holding branch Library 1) out from Library 1
    - Check the item out from Library 2
    => Confirm the checkout (should work with and without this patch)
    
    - Set AllowReturnToBranch to holdinbranch ("only the library the item
      was checked out from").
    - Check an item (homebranch Library 1, holding branch Library 1) out from Library 1
    - Check the item out from Library 2
    => Without this patch, Koha crashed
    => With this patch, you will be warned that the checkin is not possible.
    
    Try other combinations of the AllowReturnToBranch syspref
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected

    Bug 16148 - Revised layout and behavior of marc modification template management
    
    This patch makes changes to the layout and behavior of the marc
    modification template management page to make it adhere better to common
    interaction patterns in Koha.
    
    - The initial view shows a list of templates rather than pre-selecting
      the first available template for editing.
    
    - A toolbar has been added with a "New template" button.
    
    - The initial view of existing templates has an actions menu containing
      menu items for 'Edit actions,' 'Duplicate,' and 'Delete.' It doesn't
      appear to be possible to edit an existing template's name.
    
    - The "Create template" form is no longer shown all the time.
      - Clicking the "New template" toolbar button triggers a modal with the
        form for creating a template. An existing template can be chosen to
        duplicate.
      - Choosing "Duplicate" from one of the template menus triggers the
        "New template" modal and preselects the corresponding template in
        the "duplicate" <select>.
    
    - When editing actions for a template:
      - The breadcrumbs menu now reflects that a template is being modified.
      - The template name has been added as a heading.
      - A "New action" button appears in the toolbar
      - The "Edit" and "Delete" links now have a Bootstrap button style.
      - The add/edit form is now hidden by default.
      - Clicking "New action" or "edit" shows the add or edit form.
      - Clicking "Cancel" in the add/edit form hides the form.
    
    To test, apply the patch and clear your cache if necessary.
    
    - Got to Tools ->  MARC modification templates
    - Test the "New template" button.
      - Confirm that new template creation works.
      - Confirm that duplicating a template works.
    - Test the menu items in the "Actions" menu:
      - "Duplicate" should trigger the new template modal and preselect the
        template you chose to duplicate. Confirm that the template is
        successfully duplicated.
      - "Delete" should prompt you to confirm the deletion. Test both
        cancelling and confirming this operation.
      - "Edit actions" should load the page for adding or editing actions to
        a template. Test the operations on this page: New action, edit,
        delete, changing action order.
    
        Note that this patch does not fix Bug 15814, so action descriptions
        must still not contain single quotes.

    Bug 16456: Reintroduce wording "Delete tag"
    
    "Delete tag" seems more appropriate than "Delete" on this tag, but I may
    be wrong.
    
    This patch also removes an extra space.

    Bug 16127 - Add discharge menu item to patron toolbar
    
    This patch changes the "Discharge" menu in the patron sidebar to read
    "Discharges," and adds a "Discharge" menu item to the patron toolbar.
    
    This adds some redunancy, but fits with the pattern of including "views"
    in the sidebar and "actions" in the menu. The discharge feature can be
    thought of either way.
    
    To test you must have the 'useDischarge' system preference enabled.
    
    - View the detail page for any patron.
    - Confirm that the sidebar menu reads "Discharges."
    - Confirm that the "More" menu contains a "Discharge" link which works
      correctly.

    Bug 16500: [QA Follow-up] Catch warning if branch MPL already exists
    
    The current test had no warnings, when you have no MPL branch, and only
    catches the warn from the second build on line 57. If you do have MPL,
    a warning comes from line 56.
    
    This patch fixes it by removing MPL from the test. A new branch is created
    first and then we try to create it again.

    Bug 16502: Table koha_plugin_com_bywatersolutions_kitchensink_mytable not always dropped after running Plugin.t
    
    If you run Plugin.t, the above table will still be present (when you
    did not enable UseKohaPlugins). This would trigger a warning when
    running the test a second time.
    
    Why? The uninstall call does its work not completely due to a small
    inconsistency in Koha::Plugins::Handler::delete when calling run
    without the enable_plugins parameter.
    
    This patch resolves that inconsistency and also removes an unneeded skip
    in Plugin.t in case the KitchenSink module already exists.
    Note: This is a small fix. But I wonder if the Handler routines run and
    delete should not have been implemented in Koha::Plugins::Base.
    Also note that plugins/plugins-uninstall.pl will not be affacted by this
    change, since it checks whether the pref is enabled before calling the
    delete method.
    
    Test plan:
    [1] Do not yet install this patch.
    [2] Verify that plugins are enabled in koha-conf.xml.
    [3] Disable UseKohaPlugins in System Preferences!
    [4] Run t/db_dependent/Plugins.t.
    [5] Verify that table koha_plugin_com_bywatersolutions_kitchensink_mytable
        still exists. (It should have been deleted.) Remove it manually.
    [6] Apply this patch.
    [7] Run the test again.
    [8] Verify that the table does not exist.
    [9] Run the test again (without warnings).

    Bug 12748 - Fixes duplicate serials with an "expected" status bug
    
    Added a new sub to Serials.pm to be able to get serials with their statuses.
    Now the sub ModSerialStatus checks for other serials with an "expected" status before doing anything.
    
    Also modified Serials.t to be able to test those changes.
    
    Test Plan
    1) Apply patch
    2) Run ./t/db_dependent/Serials.t
    3) Validate that there are no errors
    4) Go on "Serial collection information" page for a serial of your choice
    5) Click on "Generate next"
    6) Change the status of the original serial from "late" to "expected"
    7) Change the newly generated serial from "expected" to "delete"
    8) Validate that there are no new serials created by instruction 7 and that the serial was deleted
    9) Run ./t/db_dependent/Serials.t
    
    With QA Fixes
    
    - Use the constant instead of the code (1 vs EXPECTED)
    - Avoid interpolation in query
    - use selectall_arrayref instead of fetchall_arrayref

    Bug 16592 - Use Bootstrap modal for MARC and Card preview on acquisitions receipt summary page
    
    This patch replaces Greybox modals on the acquisitions receipt summary
    page with Bootstrap modals.
    
    To test, apply the patch and go to Acquisitions -> Invoices -> View an
    invoice ->  Go to receipt page.
    
    - In the list of pending orders, test the "MARC" and "Card" links for
      various titles. Each should trigger a Bootstrap modal with the correct
      content.
    - Repeat the same tests in the list of already received orders.

    Bug 16289: Abbreviated formatting for numbering patterns
    
    To test:
    
    1) Go to Serials -> Manage numbering patterns
    2) Create .New Numbering Pattern.
    3) Type in a name of 'Day, Month, Season' and a numbering formula of '{X} {Y} {Z}'.
    4) Set up the X field as following: add 1, every 1, set back to 1, when more than 30.
    5) Select the formatting for X. There should be six options available instead of the original three. Use the formatting 'Name of Day (abbreviated)'.
    5) Set up the Y field to add 1 every 30 reset back to 1 when more than 12. Use the formatting option 'Name of month (abbreviated)'.
    6) Set up the Z field to add 1 every 90 reset back to 1 when more than 4. Use the formatting option 'Name of season (abbreviated)'.
    8) Select a frequency of 1/day.
    9) Select a first issue publication date of Jan 1, 2016.
    10) Set X to begin with 5 and have an inner counter of 5. Set Z to begin with 3 and have an inner counter of 10.
    11) Click the 'Test Pattern' button.
    12) Abbreviated versions of the day, month and season should appear in the test pattern.

    Bug 16637: Dependency for C4::Tags not listed
    
    Added optional dependency, so as to explain why testing
    explodes when the Enhanced Content system preference
    TagsExternalDictionary is set. It is optional, because not only
    does TagsExternalDictionary have to be set, but TagsEnabled
    must be 'Allow'.
    
    Also tweaked C4/Tags.pm to ignore TagsExternalDictionary,
    if Lingua::Ispell is not installed. A warning is given.
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
     1) Set the Enhanced Content system preference
        TagsExternalDictionary to /usr/bin/ispell
    
     2) sudo apt-get install liblingua-ispell-perl
        -- should be a new install
    
     3) prove t/db_dependent/Tags.t
        -- should work fine
    
     4) sudo apt-get remove liblingua-ispell-perl
    
     5) prove t/db_dependent/Tags.t
        -- should explode
    
     6) Clear the Enhanced Content system preference
        TagsExternalDictionary
    
     7) prove t/db_dependent/Tags.t
        -- should work fine
    
     8) apply patch
    
     9) prove t/db_dependent/Tags.t
        -- should work fine
    
    10) Set the Enhanced Content system preference
        TagsExternalDictionary to /usr/bin/ispell
    
    11) prove t/db_dependent/Tags.t
        -- should work, with warning.
    
    12) sudo apt-get install liblingua-ispell-perl
    
    13) prove t/db_dependent/Tags.t
        -- should work fine
    
    14) run koha qa test tools.

    Bug 16608 - Missing entity nbsp in some XML files
    
    The special character "non breaking space" &nbsp; is not contained in XML syntax by default.
    So we add it in the file header :
    <!DOCTYPE stylesheet [<!ENTITY nbsp "&#160;" >]>
    
    Even if the source code files do no contain this character, it can be that translated files contain it.
    French for example "Titre&nbsp;:".
    
    This entity is missing in all files in koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/data/ and in some files of koha-tmpl/intranet-tmpl/prog/en/xslt.
    
    Test plan :
      - generate French templates:
        cd misc/translator
        ./translate install fr-FR
        cd ../..
      - run test:
        prove -v t/00-valid-xml.t
        you get failing error message

    Bug 16560: Translatability: Issues with "The entered " in opac-memberentry.tt
    
    This patch fixes two splitted sentences to avoid translation issues:
    
    The entered <a href="#borrower_cardnumber">card number</a> is the wrong length.
    The entered <a href="#borrower_cardnumber">card number</a> is already in use.
    
    To test:
    Apply patch and verify that html in the 2 that are changed is correct and that
    they are not splitted by a-tags.
    
    Note: I could not figure out under which conditions this code displays in
          the OPAC self registration form.

    Bug 15676 - Actions in pending offline circulation actions are not translatable
    
    This patch modifies the offline circulation transaction processing page
    so that English strings describing actions are processed in the template
    rather than being output directly from the script.
    
    To test, apply the patch and create an offline circulation file
    containing at least one checkout, one check-in, and one payment.
    
    - Upload the file and choose 'Add to offline circulation queue.'
    - View pending offline circulation actions
    - In the list of pending actions, the actions column should show "Check
      out" instead of "issue," "Check in" instead of "return," and "Payment"
      instead of "payment."
    
    Strings appear as expected.

    Bug 14605 - Corrects the individual fine's description
    
    When paying a fine, the description is built out of the borrower's type and title, instead of the actual fine's description.
    
    STEPS:
    1) in the staff, go to a user with a fine to pay.
       a) if none, go to a user and Fines>>"Create manual invoice" with a distinctive description.
    2) In Fines>>Pay fines, click the "Pay" button on the line of the fine.
    3) This will take you a "Pay an individual fine" screen, where the description will look like "Staff Mrs", for the category and title of the borrower.

    Bug 16492 - Checkouts ( and possibly checkins and other actions ) will use the patron home branch as the logged in library
    
    Bug 14507 introduced the use of checkpw in C4::SIP::ILS::Patron so that
    non-Koha internal authentication processes would be able to function via
    SIP ( LDAP et al ).
    
    The problem is that checkpw changes the userenv to that of the patron!
    This is not usually an issue in Koha because most of the time that
    patron running through checkpw is the one to be logged in.
    
    Aside from SIP2 the only other area where this may be an issue is in SCO
    when using SelfCheckoutByLogin.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) On master, check out an item to a patron via SIP2
    2) Note the checkout lists the item as having been checked out
       from the patron's home library not matter which library is was
       supposed to be checked out from.
    3) Apply this patch
    4) Re-checkout the item
    5) The item should now be checked out as if it was checked out from
       the library as defined in the SIP configuration file.

    Bug 16618: 00-load.t prematurely stops all testing
    
    Rather than add/remove regular expressions to skip modules (like bug 9054), encapsulate the decision logic into a separate function.
    
    Currently there are three libraries which trigger halts:
    Koha::NorwegianDB (which was already there)
    Koha::ElasticSearch::Indexer
    Koha::SearchEngine::Elasticsearch::Search
    
    TEST PLAN
    ---------
    1) prove t/00-load.t
       -- should barf horribly on Catmandu stuff
          if not: sudo apt-get remove libcatmandu-marc-perl
          then repeat step.
    2) apply patch
    3) prove t/00-load.t
       -- should not barf horribly
    4) run koha qa test tools
    
    NOTE: The four optional modules for Koha::NorwegianDB are
          listed in the PerlDependencies.pm, while there is
          no mention of Catmandu libraries at all there.
          This may be another bug which needs fixing.
    
    TECH NOTES (for ideas of how to tinker around):
    These three things should trigger the three module cases:
    sudo apt-get remove libcatmandu-marc-perl
    sudo apt-get remove libcatmandu-store-elasticsearch-perl
    sudo apt-get remove libconvert-basen-perl
    
    You probably had koha-perldeps installed before, so the following wil mostly fix:
    sudo apt-get install koha-perldeps libcatmandu-marc-perl
    
    And in case you didn't have elastic search stuff installed:
    echo deb http://packages.elastic.co/elasticsearch/1.7/debian stable main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elasticsearch.list
    wget -O- https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get update
    
    cd ~
    wget http://debian.koha-community.org/koha/otherthings/elasticsearch_deps.tar.gz
    tar xvf elasticsearch_deps.tar.gz
    cd es_deps
    sudo dpkg i lib*

    Bug 16428: Use the biblio framework to know if a field is mapped
    
    The subroutine _build_default_values_for_mod_marc takes the
    frameworkcode in parameter, but ModItemFromMarc did not pass it.
    It uses it to know if a field is mapped or not to a Koha field
    (C4::Koha::IsKohaFieldLinked).

    Bug 16441: Do not use a package variable to cache C4::Letters::getletter
    
    C4::Letters::getletter use a package variable (%letter) to cache letter
    returned by the subroutine.
    I have not found any direct issues caused by that but it is safer to
    remove it.
    It won't be a big deal to hit the DBMS to get a valid letter when
    needed.

    Bug 16678: updatedatabase.pl 3.23.00.006 DB upgrade crashes if subscription_numberpatterns.numberingmethod contains parentheses
    
    It seems that if subscription_numberpatterns.numberingmethod contains parentheses, updatedatabase.pl crashes when running the 3.23.00.006 DB upgrade snippet, with the following error:
    
    [Mon Jun 6 09:06:54 2016] updatedatabase.pl: Unmatched ( in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/ ( <-- HERE / at /home/koha/kohaclone/installer/data/mysql/updatedatabase.pl line 11498.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    1/ Have a Koha DB version<3.23.00.006
    2/ Create a subscription numbering with parentheses in it:
       ie "Vol. (Month, Year)" with pattern
           Vol. {X} ({Y}, {Z})
    3/ Add some serials using that numbering method so that serialseq is filled in DB:
       ie  "Vol. 16 (February, 2015)"
    4/ Run the updatedatabase.pl script either from the cli or just start the webinstaller
    5/ The error is produced
    
    To test:
    1/ apply patch
    2/ try to reproduce this issue once again, should be fixed now
    3/ have a look at the code, make sure the changes are consistent

    Bug 16455: Remove the "Too late to run INIT block" from C4::Tags
    
    The pref TagsExternalDictionary is used to tell Lingua::Ispell to use an
    other dictionary, different from the default one (/usr/bin/ispell).
    
    To do so we need to set $Lingua::Ispell::path to the expected path.
    It's currently done in the INIT block.
    
    If you try to use C4::Tags, you will get the famous "Too late to run
    INIT block at C4/Tags.pm line 74." warning. Plack use the INIT block to
    load functions at run time, when we are using C4::Tags when hitting a pl
    script, the compilation phase is finished and it's "too late to run INIT
    block" from C4::Tags.
    
    I do not really know if it has an impact on the behavior of
    Lingua::Ispell (i.e. is the path redefined?), but I know that this INIT
    block is not executed when we want.
    
    Test plan:
    under Plack,
    - hit /cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl and confirm that the warning does no
    longer appears
    - Use another dictionnary (??), fill TagsExternalDictionary with its
      path and confirm that it is used by the tags approval system

    Bug 16518: Fix Plack variable scoping problem in opac-addbybiblionumber.pl
    
    The script opac/opac-addbybiblionumber.pl is not plack safe because the
    variable @biblios is declared with our and is not assigned to an empty
    array (so not reset).
    
    The issue:
    When trying to add items to a list (virtualshelf), the biblionumbers are
    added to the @biblios variable and the list is not reset between each
    run.
    
    Test plan:
    Check from records from the result list and add them
    to a list.
    Cancel or save and re-add them (or others) to a list (same or
    different).
    => Without this patch, the list of records will never stop growing, the
    previous items added are still listed when adding new ones.
    => With this patch, the behavior is the one expected.

    Bug 16088: Introduce Koha::Cache::Memory::Lite to cache the language
    
    The goal of this patch is to avoid unecessary flush of the L1 cache on
    creating a new CGI object each time C4::Languages::getlanguage is called
    without a CGI object.
    
    The new class Koha::Cache::Memory::Lite must be flushed by the CGI
    constructor overide done in the psgi file. This new class will ease
    caching of specific stuffs used by running script.
    
    Test plan:
    At the OPAC and the intranet interfaces:
    Open 2 different browser session to simulate several users
    - Clear the cookies of the browsers
    - User 1 (U1) an User 2 (U2) should be set to the default language
      (depending on the browser settings)
    - U1 chooses another language
    - U2 refreshes and the language used must be the default one
    - U2 chooses a third language
    - U1 refreshes and must be still using the one he has choosen.
    
    Try to use a language which is not defined:
    Add &language=es-ES (if es-ES is not translated) to the url, you should
    not see the Spanish interface.

    Bug 16458: Update library when a guarantor is set
    
    If you edit a patron from the Edit link of the patron information block
    (step 1 of the memberentry script), the branchcode is not displayed. If
    you set a guarantor to a child from this form, a JavaScript error will
    be raised:
      JavaScript error form.branchcode is undefined
    
    It happens because there is the branchcode is not displayed and there is
    no element with a branchcode name.
    
    To avoid this issue, a branchcode hidden input is added to the form and
    it will be updated when a guarantor is selected (same behavior as when
    you edit a patron using the complete form).
    
    Test plan:
    Edit a patron using the Edit link of the patron info block (not the Edit
    button in the toolbar)
    Set a guarantor
    => Notice that the branchcode of the patron has been updated with the
    branchcode of the guarantor

    Bug 9543 - Show patrons messaging subscription on holds notification
    
    Display an information about a patron's messaging preferences if an item
    is checked in where the patron has put a hold.
    
    To test:
    
    - Apply patch
    - Make sure that SMS driver and TalkingTech sysprefs are defined to
      enable SMS and Phone preferences for users (SMS driver can be a dummy
      value)
    - Place a hold for a patron
    - Set patron's messaging preferences to different choices (including none)
    - Check in the item that is on hold (it has not to be checked out for the
      test
    - Verify that below the message "Hold found (item is already waiting") an
      information appears about the patron's messaging preferences.

    Bug 16005 - Standardize use of icons for delete and cancel operations
    
    This patch makes changes to Font Awesome icons in order to make icon
    choice consistent for common actions.
    
    <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> where something is deleted, removed, or
    emptied.
    
    <i class="fa fa-remove"></i> where an operation is cancelled (also where
    selections are cancelled, as in checkboxes).
    
    <i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i> for "close," as in baskets and
    windows.
    
    To test, apply the patch and view the following pages to confirm that
    the correct icon is used:
    
    - Acquisitions -> Vendor -> Vendor delete button.
    - Acquisitions -> Vendor -> Edit -> Delete contact button.
    - Acquisitions -> Invoices ->  Delete menu item.
    - Cataloging -> Edit record -> Authority search pop-up (triggered from
      the tag editor for a tag linked to an authority) -> Clear field button
    - Authorities -> Authority detail -> Delete button.
    - Tools -> Quotes editor -> Quotes delete button.
    - Reports -> View saved report -> Delete button.
    - Reports -> Saved reports -> Delete menu item.
    - Serials -> Subscription details -> Subscription close button.
    - Administration -> Budgets -> Delete menu item.
    - Administration -> Item search fields -> Delete button.
    - Administration -> Z39.50/SRU servers -> Delete menu item.
    - Catalog -> Advanced search -> Clear fields link.
    - Cataloging -> Advanced editor -> Macros -> Delete macro button.
    - Circulation -> Checkout -> Check out an item which is on hold for
      another patron. "Cancel checkout and place hold" button now uses the
      icon used elsewhere for holds.
    - Course reserves -> Course -> Delete course button.
    - Patrons -> Patron lists -> Add patrons -> Remove selected button.
    - Acquisitions -> Suggestions -> Suggestion details -> Delete button.
    - Lists -> List contents -> Remove selected button.
    
    Followed test plan, works as expected.

    Bug 16336 [Revised] UX of holds patron search with long lists of results
    
    Bug 15793 made a change to an interface which is also found in the place
    hold template. This patch creates a new include file to be used by both
    circulation.tt and request.tt so that these pages do not diverge.
    
    In the process, this patch removes some markup and JavaScript which was
    made obsolete by Bug 15793 and should have been removed.
    
    This patch also revises the sorting of the results table so that the
    patron name is sortable (Bug 16334) and the default sort is on card
    number (matching 3.20.x and 3.22.x).
    
    To test:
    
    In Circulation:
    - Perform a search by name for a patron which will
      return multiple search results.
    - The table of results which displays should look correct and work
      correctly, including DataTables sorting.
    - Clicking any table row should forward you to the checkout page for
      that patron.
    
    In the catalog:
    - Locate and place a hold on a title.
    - When prompted to select a patron to place the hold for, perform a
      search by name which will return multiple results.
    - Confirm that the table of patron results looks correct and works
      correctly.
    - Clicking any table row should forward you to the place hold page for
      that patron and the title you selected.
    
    Revision: Although the table row was clickable, you couldn't
    middle-click it to open the link in a new tab. The patron name is now a
    real link you can middle-click or right-click. The row is still
    clickable as well.

    Bug 16610 - Regression in SIP2 user password handling
    
    Previous to bug 14507, SIP2 only did internal authentication. A change
    to the way we check empty passwords has caused any empty password to
    send back a CQ of Y. Previous to that patch set, a CQ of Y would only be
    sent back of the patron password column was NULL. Now, an empty AD field
    *always* returns a CQ of Y.
    
    Test Plan:
    1) Send a patron information request with an empty AD field
       Note: You must send the AD field or you won't get back a CQ field
    2) Note you get back a CQ of Y
    3) Apply this patch
    4) Repeat step 1
    5) Note you now get back a CQ of N

    To verify the original patch, this test shows that before applying
    it the Patron Info request did not return CQ==N for an empty
    password. Note that the Patron Status did btw.
    
    After applying the original patch, the test passes for patron
    info as well as status.

    Bug 16504: (follow-up for bug 15163) Do not remove attributes of other patrons
    
    Simple patch for a silly error, this single line is going to fix a
    critical bug.
    If a patron attribute is limited to a library, all the values for that attributes
    for every patrons will be deleted.
    
    Test plan:
    Create a patron attribute limited to a library
    Set the the attribute for a patron
    Set the the attribute for another patron
    => Without this patch applied, the attribute's value for the first
    patron is deleted
    => With this patch applied, the 2 values exist in the DB after the
    second edition
